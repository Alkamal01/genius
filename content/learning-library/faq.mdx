# Frequently Asked Questions

**Purpose:** Quick answers to common questions about Git, consent, deadlines, and technical support.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Setup

### Q: Do teams need Git or Obsidian?

**A:** No, these tools are optional. If you're not comfortable with Git:
- Upload your work to the shared Google Drive
- Mark your submission as **"Need Hub help"**
- The Hub team will publish your work to the repository for you

**However**, learning Git is valuable for your development career. If you want to try, check the [submission guidelines](/processes/ground-potentialising/deploy) for a beginner-friendly guide.

### Q: How do we get help with Vercel or build errors?

**A:** Follow these steps:
1. **First**, check if your markdown files have proper formatting (no unclosed code blocks, valid frontmatter)
2. **Post in the support channel** with:
   - Screenshot of the error
   - Link to your branch/PR
   - What you were trying to do
3. **Tag** the Hub Git operator (Kamal) for urgent issues

**Common fixes:**
- Missing closing `---` in frontmatter
- Unclosed code blocks (missing closing ```)
- Special characters in filenames (use hyphens, not spaces)

---

### Q: Where do I get templates?

**A:** Templates are available in two places:
- **In the repository:** `/Templates` folder
- **On Google Drive:** Shared team folder → Templates

**Available templates:**
- PRD (Project Requirements Document)
- Daily Dev Log
- Submission Document
- System Mapping Worksheet

## 📋 Requirements & Deadlines

### Q: What evidence is required for submission?

**A:** Minimum requirements:

**Visual Evidence:**
- ✅ **3 photos minimum** showing your solution in context
- ✅ Photos should show: the problem, your prototype, people using it

**Human Evidence:**
- ✅ **3 quotes minimum** from real users/stakeholders
- ✅ Quotes should include: name (or anonymous), role, and their feedback
- ✅ **Consent required** for any identifiable people in photos or quotes

**Written Evidence:**
- ✅ **200-300 word reflection** on what you learned
- ✅ **Video link (optional but recommended)** — 2-3 minute demo or story

**Pro tip:** Collect evidence continuously, don't wait until the end!

---

### Q: What are the key dates and deadlines?

**A:** Mark your calendar:

- **Dec 03:** Team Formation (The Insight Lab) — Find your team
- **Dec 06:** The Builders' Assembly (Coding Session) — Start building
- **Dec 09:** The Refinery (Mid-way Review) — Show progress, get feedback
- **[Final Submission]:** [Date TBD] — Complete documentation due

**Daily expectations:**
- Update your dev log every day you work
- Test with real users at least once before mid-way review
- Commit evidence (photos, quotes) as you collect it

---

## 🤝 Collaboration & Process

### Q: Who merges PRs (Pull Requests)?

**A:** The Hub Lead or event organizer will merge PRs.

**Process:**
1. Submit your PR when ready for review
2. Tag it with `ready-for-review` label
3. Hub team will review within 24 hours
4. They may request changes — respond promptly
5. Once approved, they'll merge to main

**Note:** Main branch is protected to prevent accidental overwrites. This is for your safety!

---

### Q: How do we handle consent for photos and quotes?

**A:** Consent is **mandatory** for any identifiable people. Follow this process:

**For Photos:**
- ✅ Ask permission before taking photos
- ✅ Explain how the photo will be used (documentation, public presentation)
- ✅ Offer to blur faces or take photos from behind if they prefer
- ✅ Get verbal consent (written is better, but verbal is acceptable)

**For Quotes:**
- ✅ Ask if you can quote them
- ✅ Show them what you wrote and confirm it's accurate
- ✅ Ask if they want to be named or anonymous
- ✅ Document their consent (note in your log)

**Template consent statement:**
> "We're documenting this project for a hackathon. Can we include this photo/quote in our public submission? You can be anonymous if you prefer."

---

### Q: What if our team member drops out?

**A:** This happens! Here's what to do:

1. **Update your team status** in the pods/teams directory
2. **Post in the matchmaking channel** if you need a replacement
3. **Adjust your scope** — it's better to do less well than more poorly
4. **Talk to a mentor** — they can help you re-scope

**Remember:** A 3-person team with a focused solution beats a 5-person team with an overambitious plan.

---

## 🎯 Project Scope & Strategy

### Q: Our idea is too big. How do we scope it down?

**A:** Great question! Follow the "Smallest Testable Version" approach:

**Instead of:** "An app for all market vendors in the city"
**Start with:** "SMS system for 5 onion vendors in one section"

**Ask yourself:**
- What's the **core problem** we're solving?
- What's the **smallest version** that tests our assumption?
- Can we test it with **5 people in 3 days**?

**Rule of thumb:** If you can't test it with real users by Dec 06, it's too big.

---

### Q: We're stuck. Who can help?

**A:** You have multiple support channels:

**For technical issues:**
- 💬 **Support channel** (Telegram/Discord)
- 👨‍💻 **Hub Git operator** (Kamal) — for build/deployment issues
- 📚 **Learning Library** — check the guides first

**For project/design issues:**
- 🎓 **Mentors** — book office hours (links in team directory)
- 👥 **Other teams** — share learnings in the community channel
- 📖 **Regenerative Development guide** — for framing questions

**For personal/team issues:**
- 🤝 **Event organizers** — reach out privately
- 👥 **Team retrospective** — talk it out with your team first

**Pro tip:** Describe what you've already tried when asking for help. "We tried X, expected Y, got Z instead" gets better responses than "It doesn't work."

---

## 📱 Communication & Updates

### Q: How often should we update our dev log?

**A:** **Every day you work on the project**, even if it's just 30 minutes.

**Good dev log entries include:**
- What you did today (be specific)
- What you learned or discovered
- What you're doing next
- Any blockers or questions

**Example:**
```
## Dec 04, 2024
- Interviewed 3 vendors at Sabon Gari market
- Learned: They already use WhatsApp for coordination
- Next: Design SMS system that integrates with existing WhatsApp groups
- Blocker: Need to understand mobile money API
```

---

### Q: Can we change our project idea after starting?

**A:** Yes, **but do it early** (before Dec 06 if possible).

**Good reasons to pivot:**
- User research revealed a different, more urgent problem
- Your original idea isn't technically feasible in the timeframe
- You discovered someone already solved your problem well

**Bad reasons to pivot:**
- It's harder than you thought (push through!)
- You saw another team's "cooler" idea
- You haven't tested with users yet (test first!)

**Process:**
1. Talk to a mentor first
2. Update your PRD
3. Notify the Hub team
4. Document why you pivoted (this is valuable learning!)

## 🏆 Judging & Presentation

### Q: What are judges looking for?

**A:** Judges prioritize **impact over impressiveness**:

**High value:**
- ✅ Evidence of real user testing
- ✅ Clear understanding of the problem context
- ✅ Thoughtful reflection on what you learned
- ✅ Realistic plan for long-term stewardship
- ✅ Solutions that build local capacity

**Lower value:**
- ❌ Polished UI with no user testing
- ❌ Complex technology with no clear benefit
- ❌ Generic solutions not adapted to local context
- ❌ "We'll scale to millions" without proving it works for 5 people

**Remember:** A simple solution that **actually helps 5 people** beats a sophisticated app that helps no one.

---

### Q: Do we need a working prototype?

**A:** You need **evidence of testing**, not necessarily a fully working product.

**Acceptable evidence:**
- Paper prototype tested with 5 users + their feedback
- Working SMS system tested with 3 vendors + quotes
- Physical prototype (e.g., collection drum) + photos of people using it
- Wizard-of-Oz test (you manually do what the tech would do) + documentation

**Not acceptable:**
- "We plan to test it next week"
- "Our friends said it's a good idea"
- "We built it but haven't shown it to anyone yet"

**Key principle:** Real feedback from real users in real contexts.
