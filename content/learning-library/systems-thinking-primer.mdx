# Systems Thinking — starter prompts

## Short Text

Systems thinking helps you see causes, not just symptoms. Use simple mapping: actors, flows, constraints, leverage points.

## Practical Exercise

Draw a simple map of the market waste system — actors (vendors, collectors), flows (waste → drains), constraints (collection costs), possible leverage: collection drum + micro-payments.
