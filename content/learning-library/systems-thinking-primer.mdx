# Systems Thinking — Starter Prompts

**Purpose:** Short introduction and practical prompts for mapping systems to understand root causes, not just symptoms.

---

## 🔍 What is Systems Thinking?

Systems thinking helps you see the **whole picture** — the connections, patterns, and root causes behind problems, not just the visible symptoms.

Instead of asking "How do we fix this broken thing?" systems thinking asks:
- **Why is it broken?** (Root causes)
- **Who and what is connected to it?** (Actors and relationships)
- **Where can small changes create big impact?** (Leverage points)

## 🧩 Four Key Elements to Map

When analyzing any problem, look for these four elements:

### 1. **Actors** 
Who are the people, organizations, or entities involved?

*Example (Market Waste):* Vendors, customers, waste collectors, local government, recycling cooperatives, drainage maintenance workers

### 2. **Flows**
What moves through the system? (Materials, money, information, trust)

*Example:* 
- Waste flows from vendors → drains → flooding
- Money flows from customers → vendors
- Information flows through word-of-mouth networks

### 3. **Constraints**
What limits or blocks desired outcomes?

*Example:*
- Collection costs too high for individual vendors
- No trust in payment systems
- Lack of nearby recycling facilities
- Cultural norms around waste disposal

### 4. **Leverage Points**
Where can small interventions create disproportionate positive change?

*Example:*
- A visible collection drum at market entrance (changes behavior)
- Micro-payments via mobile money (removes cost barrier)
- One enthusiastic vendor champion (builds trust)

## 🎨 Practical Exercise: Map Your System

Follow these steps to create a simple system map for your problem:

### Step 1: Draw the Actors (5 minutes)
- Write down all the people/groups involved
- Circle the ones with the most power or influence
- Star the ones most affected by the problem

### Step 2: Map the Flows (5 minutes)
- Draw arrows showing what moves between actors
- Label each arrow (waste, money, information, etc.)
- Use different colors for different types of flows

### Step 3: Identify Constraints (5 minutes)
- Write down what's blocking desired outcomes
- Categorize: Physical? Economic? Social? Technical?
- Mark which constraints you might be able to influence

### Step 4: Find Leverage Points (10 minutes)
- Look for places where multiple flows intersect
- Identify actors who could become champions
- Find small changes that could shift behavior patterns

## 📊 Example: Market Waste System Map

### Actors
- **Vendors** (200+ stalls) — generate waste, pay for space
- **Waste collectors** (informal, 5-10 people) — collect for resale
- **Market manager** — controls space allocation
- **Customers** (5,000+ daily) — generate packaging waste
- **Recycling cooperative** (nearby) — buys sorted plastic

### Flows
- **Waste flow:** Vendors → ground → drains → flooding
- **Money flow:** Customers → vendors → market fees
- **Information flow:** Vendor networks (WhatsApp groups, word-of-mouth)

### Constraints
- **Economic:** Individual collection too expensive ($2/day per vendor)
- **Trust:** Previous "reward" schemes failed, vendors skeptical
- **Infrastructure:** No bins, drains designed for water only
- **Behavioral:** "Someone else's problem" mentality

### Leverage Points
1. **Collective collection drum** — Shared cost, visible progress
2. **Mobile money micro-payments** — Builds trust through transparency
3. **Vendor champion network** — One per section, peer influence
4. **Visual feedback** — Painted fill markers show community impact

## 💡 Key Questions for Your Team

Use these prompts to deepen your systems understanding:

### Understanding Interconnections
- What happens upstream and downstream of our intervention?
- Who benefits if this problem continues? (Sometimes problems persist because they serve someone)
- What unintended consequences might our solution create?

### Finding Root Causes
- Ask "Why?" five times to get past symptoms
- What would happen if we did nothing?
- What's the difference between what people say and what they do?

### Designing Interventions
- Where are the feedback loops? (What reinforces current behavior?)
- Can we work with existing flows instead of creating new ones?
- What's the smallest intervention that could test our assumptions?

## 🛠️ Tools and Templates

### Simple System Mapping Template
```
PROBLEM: [One sentence]

ACTORS:
- [Name] — [Role/Interest]
- [Name] — [Role/Interest]

FLOWS:
- [What] flows from [Actor A] to [Actor B]

CONSTRAINTS:
- [Type]: [Description]

LEVERAGE POINTS:
1. [Intervention idea] — [Why it might work]
```

### The "5 Whys" Technique
```
Problem: Plastic waste blocks drains

Why? → Vendors dispose of waste on the ground
Why? → No convenient collection system
Why? → Individual collection too expensive
Why? → No shared infrastructure
Why? → No one has organized collective action

ROOT CAUSE: Lack of collective action infrastructure
```

## ✅ Systems Thinking Checklist

Before finalizing your solution:

- [ ] Have we mapped all the key actors in this system?
- [ ] Do we understand what flows through the system?
- [ ] Have we identified the root causes, not just symptoms?
- [ ] Can we name at least 3 constraints we're working with?
- [ ] Have we found leverage points where small changes could have big impact?
- [ ] Have we considered unintended consequences?

> **Remember:** The goal isn't to map everything perfectly. It's to see patterns and connections you might have missed by looking at the problem in isolation.
