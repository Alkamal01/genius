## Example Story (copyable)

**Waste-to-Value in Sabon Gari Market**

*The place & problem:* Sabon Gari market generates over 200kg of plastic waste daily, most of which ends up blocking drainage systems and creating health hazards for the 5,000+ daily vendors and shoppers.

*The human story:* "Every morning I sweep plastic bottles from my stall entrance," says Amina, a vegetable vendor. "When it rains, the drains overflow because of all the plastic. My goods get damaged, and customers don't want to walk through the mess."

*What we tried:* We installed a collection drum with a simple SMS-based reward system where collectors earn micro-payments for each kilogram of plastic deposited, verified by a local weighing station.

*What we learned:*
- Trust is built slowly—vendors needed three weeks to believe the payment system was real
- Visual feedback matters—a simple painted fill-level marker on the drum increased participation by 40%
- Local champions are essential—one enthusiastic vendor recruited 15 others

*What comes next:* We're testing a second drum location and working with the local recycling cooperative to create a sustainable collection route. Our goal is to have five drums operational by the end of the month, with a long-term plan for vendor-led stewardship.

## Tips for Strong Stories

- **Be specific:** Use numbers, names (with consent), and concrete details
- **Show, don't tell:** Include photos, quotes, and real observations
- **Focus on people:** Technology is the tool, not the hero
- **Be honest:** Share what didn't work—it shows learning and builds trust
