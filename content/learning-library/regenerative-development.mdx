# Regenerative Development — Primer

## Short Intro

Short practical summary: listen, work with existing systems, plan for long-term stewardship and measure human impact not just lines of code.

## Key Ideas

* Start with people and place — not the technology

* Prototype quickly, test with real people, learn, iterate

* Prioritize solutions that regenerate local capacity

## Suggested Prompts for Teams

* Who are the stewards of this problem?
* What local knowledge exists?
* How can we support, not replace?
