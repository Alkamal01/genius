## The Purpose
Before a single line of code is written, you must establish what we call a "container"—a shared understanding of the place you're serving and the lives within it. This phase is about activating your senses and moving beyond assumptions into direct, embodied experience.

## The Four Movements
Think of these as a ritual, not a checklist. Each movement builds on the last, taking you deeper into relationship with your chosen community.

### Movement I: Explore (The Walk)
Leave your laptops behind. Walk your chosen location—whether it's a neighborhood, a market, a rural village, or an urban corridor—until you can "feel the smell of the place."

*   **Notice everything:** the rhythm of foot traffic, the sounds at different times of day, where people gather, where they avoid.
*   **Identify physical patterns:** What's abundant? What's missing? What's broken? What's thriving?
*   **Walk slowly enough** to be surprised.
*   **Take photos**, but don't hide behind the camera.

> **Guiding Principle:** You're not conducting surveillance; you're beginning a relationship.

### Movement II: Imagery (The Draw)
Find a quiet spot within or near your location. Set a timer for exactly ten minutes. Now, capture what you've absorbed—not through words or logic, but through image and metaphor.

*   **Sketch abstract representations** of what you felt.
*   **Arrange local objects** (rocks, flowers, sticks, bottle caps) into patterns that express the place's energy.
*   **Use colors, shapes, textures**—anything but literal documentation.
*   **Don't worry about artistic skill**; worry about honesty.

### Movement III: Connect (The Talk)
Now comes the most important movement: seeking out the caretakers. These are the people who hold the memory and the dream of the place.

#### Who to Talk To:
1.  **Elders (Keepers of History):** Those who remember what was, who understand the deep patterns, who can tell you what's been tried before and why certain things matter.
2.  **Young Leaders (Keepers of the Future):** The emerging voices, the ones already organizing, the youth who see what's possible.

#### Ask Open-Ended Questions:
*   *"What do you love most about this place?"*
*   *"What breaks your heart here?"*
*   *"If you could change one thing, what would it be?"*
*   *"What solutions have been tried before? What happened?"*

**Record these conversations (with permission).** The stories they share won't be found on Google, Facebook, or any database. This is **Ground Truth**.

> [!TIP]
> **Guiding Principle:** Technology without relationship is just expensive decoration.

### Movement IV: Expression (The Write)
Return to your team space. While the encounters are still fresh, each team member should spend 20-30 minutes in individual reflection, synthesizing what you experienced into raw text or poetry.

*   **Write in whatever language feels most true.**
*   **Don't edit for grammar or structure**—this is about capturing spirit.
*   **Include direct quotes** from community members.
*   **Notice what surprised you**, what moved you, what unsettled you.

Then, come together and share what you've written. Listen for the threads that weave through everyone's experience. This is where your project begins to take shape—not from your idea, but from what the place revealed to you.
