# Mentorship & Support — How to Request and What to Expect

**Purpose:** How teams request mentors, what mentors will do, and rules for mentor engagement.

---

## 🎓 How to Request a Mentor

### Step 1: Fill the Mentorship Request Form

Complete the **[Mentorship Request Form](https://tally.so/r/Y5jlaW)** with specific details:

**Required information:**
- Team name and members
- Current project stage (research, prototyping, testing, etc.)
- **Specific help required** — Be precise! Examples:
  - "Need help integrating mobile money API"
  - "Want feedback on our user research approach"
  - "Need advice on finding testing sites in Sabon Gari"
  - "Stuck on database schema design"

**Not helpful:** "We need general help" or "We want a mentor"

### Step 2: Show Your Work

Mentors prioritize teams that demonstrate:
- ✅ Evidence of progress (photos, code, prototypes)
- ✅ Clear next steps (you know what you need to do)
- ✅ Specific blockers (you can articulate what's stopping you)

**Pro tip:** Include links to your dev log or work-in-progress when requesting mentorship.

### Step 3: Matching & Scheduling

- **Matching:** Hub team matches you with appropriate mentor within 24-48 hours
- **Scheduling:** Mentor will contact you to schedule 1-hour session
- **Preparation:** You'll receive a prep checklist before the session

## 👨‍🏫 What Mentors Provide

### During 1-Hour Sessions

Mentors can help with:

**Technical guidance:**
- Code review and architecture advice
- Debugging complex problems
- Technology selection and trade-offs
- Best practices and patterns

**Project guidance:**
- User research methods
- Problem framing and scoping
- Testing strategies
- Presentation and storytelling

**Resource connections:**
- Links to relevant documentation
- Introductions to domain experts
- Suggestions for testing sites or user groups
- References to similar projects

### Written Feedback

After sessions, mentors may provide:
- Summary of discussion points
- Action items and next steps
- Links to resources mentioned
- Follow-up questions to consider

---

## 🚫 What Mentors Do NOT Do

To maintain fairness and learning:

- ❌ **Write code for your team** — They'll guide, but you build
- ❌ **Make decisions for you** — They'll present options, you choose
- ❌ **Guarantee success** — They support, but outcomes depend on your work
- ❌ **Provide unlimited time** — Sessions are time-boxed to 1 hour
- ❌ **Do your research** — They'll point you in the right direction

**Remember:** Mentors are guides, not team members. The work is yours.

---

## 🎯 Mentor Matching Rules

### Priority System

Mentors are allocated based on:

1. **Evidence of work** — Teams showing progress get priority
2. **Clear next steps** — Teams who know what they need learn more
3. **Specific requests** — Targeted questions get better matches
4. **First-time requesters** — New teams get priority over repeat requests

### Mentor Specializations

Mentors have different expertise areas:

- **Technical mentors:** Backend, frontend, mobile, APIs, databases
- **Business mentors:** Market validation, business models, sustainability
- **Design mentors:** UI/UX, user research, testing methods
- **Domain mentors:** Agriculture, waste management, healthcare, education, etc.

**Request the right type** based on your current needs.

## 📝 How to Prepare for a Mentor Session

### Before the Session (24 hours prior)

- [ ] Review your dev log and identify specific questions
- [ ] Prepare materials to share (code, prototypes, research notes)
- [ ] Write down your 3 most important questions
- [ ] Identify what you've already tried
- [ ] Set a clear goal for the session

### During the Session

- [ ] **Start with context** — Brief project overview (2 minutes max)
- [ ] **Ask specific questions** — Don't wait for mentor to guess
- [ ] **Take notes** — Capture advice, resources, action items
- [ ] **Show your work** — Demos, screenshots, prototypes
- [ ] **Clarify next steps** — Confirm what you'll do after the session

### After the Session

- [ ] **Update your dev log** — Document what you learned
- [ ] **Follow through** — Complete the action items discussed
- [ ] **Share progress** — Update mentor on outcomes (optional but appreciated)

## 💡 Getting the Most from Mentorship

### Good Questions to Ask

✅ **Specific and actionable:**
- "We're choosing between SMS and WhatsApp for notifications. What trade-offs should we consider?"
- "Our users aren't engaging with the prototype. What testing methods could reveal why?"
- "This API call is failing. Here's the code and error. What am I missing?"

❌ **Too vague:**
- "How do we make our app better?"
- "What should we build?"
- "Can you look at everything and tell us what's wrong?"

### Describe What You've Tried

**Good approach:**
> "We tried X, expected Y, but got Z instead. We've looked at A and B resources. We think the issue might be C, but we're not sure."

**Less helpful:**
> "It doesn't work. Can you fix it?"

---

## 🔄 Follow-Up Sessions

### When to Request Follow-Up

- ✅ You've completed action items from first session
- ✅ New blockers emerged after implementing advice
- ✅ You need deeper dive on a complex topic
- ✅ You're at a new project stage (e.g., moved from prototype to testing)

### When NOT to Request Follow-Up

- ❌ You haven't tried the suggestions from first session
- ❌ You're asking the same questions without showing progress
- ❌ You want mentor to do the work for you

**Note:** Follow-up requests are granted based on availability and demonstrated progress.
