## The Purpose
This final phase is about making value visible—not just to judges, but to the community you served, your future selves, and the broader ecosystem. You're not just presenting a demo; you're telling a story of transformation.

## Joint Stakeholder Assessment
This is your main event: a 10-minute presentation followed by Q&A with a diverse panel of stakeholders.

### Your audience will include:
*   Community members you worked with.
*   Technical judges from the Cardano ecosystem.
*   Potential funders or partners.
*   Fellow hackathon teams.

### Structure your presentation:
1.  **The Calling (1 min):** What drew you to this place and this problem?
2.  **The Journey (3 min):**
    *   Show photos from your walks.
    *   Share quotes from elders and young leaders.
    *   Reveal the surprising insights that shaped your direction.
3.  **The Solution (4 min):**
    *   Live demo of your working prototype.
    *   Show how it addresses the **Ground Truth** you discovered.
    *   Highlight the **Bridge feedback** that changed your approach.
4.  **The Future (2 min):**
    *   What's next for this project?
    *   What would you do with more time/resources?
    *   How could this scale or inspire other communities?

### Q&A Tips:
*   **Welcome hard questions**—they make your work stronger.
*   **If community members speak**, listen deeply.
*   **Admit what you don't know** or didn't finish.
*   **Focus on learning**, not defending.

> [!TIP]
> **Guiding Principle:** Vulnerability is strength. Share the messy middle, not just the polished end.

## The Final Case Study
Your Scribe leads this effort, but everyone contributes. This document is your legacy—it ensures that even if your code doesn't scale, your learning does.

### Required Sections:

#### 1. Executive Summary (1 page)
*   The problem you addressed.
*   Your solution in one sentence.
*   Key impact metrics (even if projected).

#### 2. The Ground Truth (2-3 pages)
*   Description of the place and community.
*   Key insights from The Four Movements.
*   Direct quotes from community members.
*   Photos and imagery from Phase 1.

#### 3. The Journey (2-3 pages)
*   Evolution of your hypothesis.
*   Key pivot moments and Bridge feedback.
*   Challenges faced and how you adapted.
*   Your Emergent Learning Matrix (include the actual artifact).

#### 4. The Solution (3-4 pages)
*   Technical architecture and Cardano implementation.
*   User journey with screenshots.
*   How it embodies "Speed to Trust."
*   Code repository and documentation links.

#### 5. Impact & Future (1-2 pages)
*   How community members responded to the prototype.
*   Potential for scale or replication.
*   Next steps for continued development.
*   Lessons for other teams.

#### 6. Appendices
*   Full interview transcripts (anonymized if needed).
*   Technical documentation.
*   Raw data from Bridge visits.
*   Team reflections.

### Submission:
*   Submit to Prisma/Wada by [deadline].
*   Include a 2-minute video summary.
*   Make your case study open-source for others to learn from.
