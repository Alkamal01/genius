## The Purpose
You've gathered raw insight. Now it's time to crystallize that wisdom into a buildable hypothesis—a clear north star that will guide your technical work while keeping you rooted in community truth.

## Role Alignment: Building Your Capacity Team
Traditional hackathons assign roles like "frontend developer" or "project manager." At CATS, we work differently. You're building capacity-generating roles that create value beyond code.

Assign these roles thoughtfully within your team:

### 1. The Weaver (1-2 people)
*   Maintains ongoing relationships with community stakeholders.
*   Orchestrates feedback loops between team and community.
*   Ensures the project serves, not extracts.
*   Guards against mission drift.

### 2. The Scribe (1 person)
*   Documents the journey in narrative form.
*   Captures quotes, insights, and turning points.
*   Prepares the final case study.
*   Makes the invisible work visible.

### 3. The Developers (2-4 people)
*   Technical implementation using Cardano blockchain.
*   Ensures "Speed to Trust" in all interfaces.
*   Builds for the least tech-savvy user in the community.
*   Creates open, auditable, maintainable code.

### 4. The Bridge (can be the Weaver or a dedicated role)
*   Takes prototypes back to the community for validation.
*   Translates between technical and non-technical worlds.
*   Tests assumptions against Ground Truth.
*   Brings reality checks before teams go too far down wrong paths.

> [!TIP]
> **Guiding Principle:** Every role is essential. The Weaver is as important as the lead developer.

## The Emergent Learning Matrix
This is your sense-making tool. Create a large four-quadrant grid (poster paper works well) and continuously populate it as you work.

### How to use it:

1.  **Ground Truth (bottom-left):** Start here. Fill this with concrete observations.
    *   *"80% of vendors are women over 50."*
    *   *"Mobile money is used but not trusted."*
    *   *"Elders mentioned a failed project in 2019."*

2.  **Insights (top-right):** Move to patterns and surprises.
    *   *"Trust is visual—people need to see transactions happen."*
    *   *"The real barrier isn't technology, it's literacy."*
    *   *"Young people want to participate but feel excluded from decision-making."*

3.  **Hypotheses (bottom-right):** Form testable beliefs.
    *   *"If we create a picture-based interface, adoption will increase."*
    *   *"A physical receipt + digital record might bridge the trust gap."*

4.  **Opportunities (top-left):** Define what you'll build.
    *   *"A marketplace with visual verification."*
    *   *"A community treasury with elder oversight."*
    *   *"A micro-credential system for local skills."*

Update this matrix daily. Your final case study will draw heavily from this artifact.

## Crystallizing Your Build Statement
By the end of Phase 2, you should be able to complete this sentence as a team:

> "We are building **[WHAT]** for **[WHOM]** because **[GROUND TRUTH]** revealed that **[INSIGHT]**, and we believe **[HYPOTHESIS]** will create **[OPPORTUNITY]**."

This becomes your north star. When you're stuck, return to this statement.
