Participants Handbook
Participants Handbook: The Journey of Ground-Potentialising
CATS Hackathon 2025
________________


Welcome to a Different Kind of Hackathon
The Cardano Africa Tech Summit (CATS) Hackathon is not your typical coding competition. This is a regenerative process—a carefully designed journey that moves you from surface-level observation to discovering the essence of your community's needs.
Over the coming days, you will become Ground-Potentialisers: technologists who don't just build solutions, but who first deeply understand place, listen to those who hold its stories, and co-create futures rooted in local wisdom and global possibility.
This handbook is your companion through four transformative phases. Use it as a map, but remember: the territory you're exploring is alive, unpredictable, and full of emergence.
