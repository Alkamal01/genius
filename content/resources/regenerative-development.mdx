# Regenerative Development — Primer

**Purpose:** A practical primer and reading links for teams building solutions that strengthen communities.

## 🌱 What is Regenerative Development?

Regenerative development goes beyond "doing less harm" (sustainability) to actively **improving the health and vitality** of the communities and ecosystems we work with. It's about creating solutions that:

- **Listen first** — Understand the context before proposing solutions
- **Work with existing systems** — Build on what already works, don't replace it
- **Plan for long-term stewardship** — Design for maintenance and local ownership
- **Measure human impact** — Track wellbeing, not just lines of code or user metrics

---

## 🎯 Core Principles

### 1. Start with People and Place — Not the Technology

**Why it matters:** Technology is a tool, not a solution. The best solutions emerge from deep understanding of local context, culture, and needs.

**In practice:**
- Spend time in the community before coding
- Interview stakeholders, observe daily patterns
- Ask: "What already works here?" before asking "What's broken?"

**Example:** Instead of building a new app for market vendors, first understand how they currently communicate, track inventory, and build trust with customers.

### 2. Prototype Quickly, Test with Real People, Learn, Iterate

**Why it matters:** Assumptions fail. Real feedback from real users in real contexts is the only way to build something useful.

**In practice:**
- Build the smallest testable version first
- Test with 3-5 real users, not friends or family
- Document what surprised you — those insights are gold

**Example:** A simple SMS system tested with 5 vendors teaches you more than a polished app tested with no one.

### 3. Prioritize Solutions that Regenerate Local Capacity

**Why it matters:** The best solutions make communities **more capable**, not more dependent on external technology or expertise.

**In practice:**
- Design for local maintenance and ownership
- Train local champions who can support others
- Use technology that can be understood and fixed locally

**Example:** A solar-powered collection drum with a simple mechanical counter is better than a cloud-connected IoT device if no one can fix it when it breaks.

## 💡 Suggested Prompts for Teams

Before you start building, ask yourselves:

### Understanding the System
- **Who are the stewards of this problem?** (Who already cares and is working on it?)
- **What local knowledge exists?** (What do people already know that we don't?)
- **What's already working?** (What shouldn't we break or replace?)

### Designing for Regeneration
- **How can we support, not replace?** (How do we strengthen existing efforts?)
- **Who will maintain this in 6 months?** (Is there a clear path to local ownership?)
- **What capacity are we building?** (Are we making the community more or less self-reliant?)

### Measuring Impact
- **What changes for people?** (Not just what the technology does)
- **Who benefits most?** (And who might be left out or harmed?)
- **What happens if we leave?** (Is the solution sustainable without us?)

## ✅ Quick Self-Check

Before your next check-in, ask:

- [ ] Have we spent time listening to the community?
- [ ] Can we name 3 things that already work in this context?
- [ ] Have we tested our prototype with real users?
- [ ] Do we know who will maintain this solution long-term?
- [ ] Are we measuring human impact, not just technical metrics?

> **Remember:** The goal isn't to build the most impressive technology. It's to create lasting positive change for real people in real places.
