# Regenerative Development — Practical Guide

**Purpose:** Brief, practical summary and prompts for teams on how to apply regenerative principles in the field.

---

## 🌍 What is Regenerative Development?

Regenerative development means **designing solutions that restore local systems** — socially, economically, and ecologically. 

It's not just about "doing less harm" (sustainability). It's about actively **improving** the health and capacity of the communities and ecosystems you work with.

### Core Focus Areas

- **Listening** — Understanding context before proposing solutions
- **Co-creating** — Working with users, not for them
- **Thinking long-term** — Planning for stewardship beyond the hackathon

---

## 💡 Practical Prompts for Teams

Before you build, during testing, and before submission, ask yourselves these questions:

### 1. Who Benefits?

**Question:** *Who benefits if this succeeds — name 3 specific people or groups?*

**Why it matters:** Vague answers like "the community" or "everyone" suggest you haven't talked to real people yet.

**Good answer example:**
- Amina, the vegetable vendor, saves 30 minutes daily on waste cleanup
- The market manager reduces drainage maintenance costs by 40%
- Local recycling cooperative gains consistent plastic supply

---

### 2. What Can You Build On?

**Question:** *What existing local practice can we build on or partner with?*

**Why it matters:** Communities already have systems, knowledge, and relationships. Building on what works is faster and more sustainable than starting from scratch.

**Good answer example:**
- Vendors already use WhatsApp groups for coordination
- Informal waste collectors already know the routes and timing
- The recycling cooperative already has weighing and payment systems

---

### 3. What Changes Long-Term?

**Question:** *How will this change local livelihoods or systems after 6–12 months?*

**Why it matters:** If your solution disappears when you leave, it wasn't regenerative.

**Good answer example:**
- Vendors develop collective action capacity they can apply to other problems
- Waste collectors gain reliable income stream, reducing economic precarity
- Market becomes a model for other markets in the region

## ✅ Regenerative Development Checklist

Use this checklist throughout your project:

### Before You Start Building

- [ ] Have we spent time observing the problem in its real context?
- [ ] Have we interviewed at least 5 people affected by this problem?
- [ ] Can we name existing practices or systems we're building on?
- [ ] Do we know who the local "stewards" of this problem are?

### During Development

- [ ] Are we testing with real users, not friends or family?
- [ ] Have we obtained proper consent from everyone we photograph or quote?
- [ ] Are we documenting what surprises us (not just what confirms our assumptions)?
- [ ] Are we tracking real-world outcomes (numbers, stories, photos)?

### Before Submission

- [ ] Can we name 3 specific people who benefit and how?
- [ ] Do we have evidence of real user testing (photos, quotes, feedback)?
- [ ] Have we identified who will maintain this after we're done?
- [ ] Are we honest about what didn't work and what we learned?

## 🎯 Regenerative vs. Extractive Approaches

Understanding the difference helps you stay on track:

| Regenerative ✅ | Extractive ❌ |
|---|---|
| "How can we support what already works?" | "We'll replace the broken system" |
| Testing with 5 real users | Building without user feedback |
| Training local champions | Creating dependency on external experts |
| Simple, locally maintainable tech | Complex tech no one can fix |
| Measuring human impact | Measuring only technical metrics |
| Honest about failures | Only showing successes |

---

## 📖 Real-World Application

### Example: Market Waste Collection

**Extractive approach:**
- Build sophisticated app with cloud database
- Require smartphones and data plans
- Manage system remotely from outside
- Measure success by app downloads

**Regenerative approach:**
- Start with SMS (works on basic phones)
- Build on existing WhatsApp coordination
- Train vendor champions to manage system
- Measure success by waste collected and vendor income

**Result:** The regenerative approach is more likely to still be working 6 months later.

## 🤝 Community Consent & Ethics

Regenerative development requires ethical engagement:

### Consent Principles

- **Informed:** People understand how their data/images will be used
- **Voluntary:** No pressure or coercion to participate
- **Ongoing:** People can withdraw consent at any time
- **Documented:** You have proof of consent (written or recorded verbal)

### Ethical Questions

- Are we extracting value (data, stories, photos) without giving back?
- Do participants have agency in how they're represented?
- Are we reinforcing stereotypes or showing people's full humanity?
- Who owns the intellectual property of this solution?

## 💬 Questions to Discuss with Your Team

Use these for team retrospectives or mentor sessions:

1. **Listening:** What surprised us when we talked to users? What assumptions were wrong?

2. **Co-creation:** Are we designing *with* the community or *for* them? How do we know?

3. **Long-term:** If we disappeared tomorrow, would this solution continue? Why or why not?

4. **Capacity:** Are we making the community more capable or more dependent?

5. **Honesty:** What's not working? What are we avoiding talking about?

> **Remember:** The goal isn't to build the most impressive technology. It's to create lasting positive change that continues after you're gone.

> **Next Steps:** Apply these principles using the **[Systems Thinking Primer](/learning-library/systems-thinking-primer)** to map your problem space.
