# Regenerative Development — practical guide

## Short Paragraph

Regenerative development means designing solutions that restore local systems — socially, economically and ecologically. It focuses on listening, co-creating with users, and thinking long-term.

## Practical Prompts for Teams

* Who benefits if this succeeds — name 3 people or groups?

* What existing local practice can we build on or partner with?

* How will this change local livelihoods or systems after 6–12 months?

## Short Checklist

* Ensure community consent
* Test with real users
* Track real-world outcomes (numbers, stories, photos)
