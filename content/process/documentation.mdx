## 🎯 Quality Standards

### Minimum Acceptable Evidence

**Photos:**
- Clear, well-lit, in focus
- Show real context (not staged)
- Include people interacting with solution (with consent)

**Quotes:**
- From real users/stakeholders (not team members)
- Include name or "Anonymous" + role
- Specific feedback, not generic praise

**Reflection:**
- Honest about what worked AND what didn't
- Specific learnings, not vague statements
- Clear next steps or recommendations

---

## ⚠️ Common Rejection Reasons

Submissions are returned for revision if they:

- ❌ Missing required files (especially consent)
- ❌ Files not named according to convention
- ❌ Photos don't show real testing/users
- ❌ No evidence of actual user feedback
- ❌ Reflection is too vague or generic
- ❌ Video >50MB uploaded directly (should be linked)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Start collecting evidence early** — Don't wait until the deadline
- **Get consent immediately** — Ask when you take photos, not weeks later
- **Name files as you go** — Don't rename 50 files at the end
- **Use the templates** — They ensure you don't miss anything
- **Ask for help** — Hub team can review drafts before final submission
