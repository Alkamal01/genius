# WA_SKYFISH25 — Ashaka Energy Commons Journey

## Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The team immersed themselves in Ashaka, Gombe State, identifying a chronic crisis where electricity is available for only 1-2 hours at night.

This crippled the livelihoods of artisans like Mallam Abdullaziz, whose machinery sat idle during the day. The team found that vandalism (costing the community ₦2 million in repairs) and a lack of trust in the grid were major blockers.

## Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
The team initially planned for centralized alerts but pivoted after resident input showed a need for **community ownership**.

They built the Ashaka Energy Commons, a mobile-first webapp that turns residents into "Energy Stewards":
*   **Input:** Residents log ON/OFF events and report risks
*   **Process:** Local validators confirm the reports
*   **Reward:** System mints Energy Steward Tokens

## Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The final solution anchors community reports on the Cardano blockchain. This ensures that data regarding outages and repairs is tamper-proof, eliminating middlemen and building a trusted history of the community's energy profile.
