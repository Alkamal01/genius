## Product Journey

### Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The team immersed themselves in Ashaka, Gombe State, identifying a chronic crisis where electricity is available for only 1-2 hours at night. This crippled the livelihoods of artisans whose machinery sat idle during the day. The team found that vandalism (costing the community ₦2 million in repairs) and a lack of trust in the grid were major blockers.

**The Problem:** Unreliable power, exacerbated by infrastructure vandalism, is severely eroding community trust and economic productivity.

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Research Insight:** "Value means reliable visibility... shifting from 23% uptime planning to coordinated micro-grid use."

### Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
The team initially planned for centralized alerts but pivoted after resident input showed a need for community ownership. They built the **Ashaka Energy Commons**, a mobile-first webapp that turns residents into "Energy Stewards."

*   **Input:** Residents log ON/OFF events and report risks ("Problem spotted") via the webapp.
*   **Process:** Local validators confirm the reports.
*   **Reward:** The system mints Energy Steward Tokens to reward active monitoring.

**Top 3 Features:**
*   **Community Reporting Tool:** Simple mobile interface for logging outages and infrastructure risks.
*   **Stewardship Rewards:** Token incentives for validating grid status, gamifying maintenance.
*   **Visibility Dashboard:** Real-time data for local leaders to coordinate usage and protect assets.

### Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The final solution anchors these community reports on the Cardano blockchain. This ensures that the data regarding outages and repairs is tamper-proof.

**Technical Stack:** Laravel/PHP (Backend), Cardano (Metadata/Smart Contracts for Trust), Mobile-Web Frontend.

**Live Status:** Pilot ready for 50 users in Ashaka; Governance transition planned.

## Achievements & Reflections

Team WA_SKYFISH25's major achievement was redefining the "energy problem" as a "governance problem." By empowering youth to be guardians of the grid, they are solving the vandalism issue from the bottom up.

**Key Milestone:** Successful validation of user reports to Cardano verification.

> [!TIP]
> **The "Big Lesson":** "Data empowers leaders as an infrastructure 'immune system' against vandalism."
