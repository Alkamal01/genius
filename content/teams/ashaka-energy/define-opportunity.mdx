# Ashaka Energy — Define Opportunity

## The Opportunity
Transform unreliable power into **community-governed energy commons** through blockchain-verified stewardship.

## The Problem Scale
*   **1-2 hours** of power per night
*   **₦2 million** lost to vandalism
*   **23% uptime** across the grid

## The Unlock
By creating an "Energy Stewardship" system:
*   **Youth become guardians** — Incentivized to protect infrastructure
*   **Data becomes power** — Leaders can coordinate usage
*   **Vandalism decreases** — Community immune system activates

## Regenerative Value
The solution doesn't just report problems—it **builds governance capacity**:
*   Community owns the data
*   Decisions driven by verified information
*   Trust restored through transparency

## Vision
> "Powering dignity through visibility: A community-operated energy stewardship system."
