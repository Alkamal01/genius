# Ashaka Energy — Formulate Hypothesis

## Core Hypothesis
> **"If we turn residents into 'Energy Stewards' with token rewards for reporting, we create a community-owned immune system that protects infrastructure and coordinates usage."**

## The Stewardship Model

### Input Layer
*   Residents log ON/OFF events via mobile webapp
*   Report infrastructure risks ("Problem spotted")
*   Simple, mobile-first interface

### Validation Layer
*   Local validators confirm reports
*   Human verification before blockchain anchoring
*   Prevents false or malicious data

### Reward Layer
*   Energy Steward Tokens minted for active monitoring
*   Gamifies maintenance and protection
*   Creates positive feedback loop

## Testable Prediction
> "Communities with stewardship tokens will see reduced vandalism and better coordination of power usage."

## The Visibility Dashboard
Real-time data for local leaders to:
*   Coordinate usage during limited power windows
*   Identify and protect vulnerable infrastructure
*   Make data-driven decisions
