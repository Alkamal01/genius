# Ashaka Energy — Ground Truth

## The Discovery
Ashaka, Gombe State faces a chronic electricity crisis: power available for only **1-2 hours at night**.

## What They Found
*   Artisans' machinery **sits idle during the day**
*   **₦2 million** lost to vandalism repairs
*   **Zero trust** in the grid or promises of improvement

## The Real Problem
> "Unreliable power, exacerbated by infrastructure vandalism, is severely eroding community trust and economic productivity."

## Impact Analysis
| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Frequent outages | Life and services disrupted |
| Vandalism | Financial burden, grid instability |
| No visibility | Can't plan around power availability |

## Key Insight
> "Value means reliable visibility... The community needed to shift from 23% uptime to coordinated micro-grid use."

The team realized this wasn't just an **energy problem**—it was a **governance problem**.
