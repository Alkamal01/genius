# Ashaka Energy — Formulate Insight

## The Breakthrough
The team initially planned centralized SMS alerts. Resident input changed everything.

## Key Insight
> "This isn't an energy problem—it's a governance problem."

## What Residents Wanted
*   **Ownership**, not just alerts
*   **Recognition** for protecting infrastructure
*   **Visibility** into grid status

## The Shift
| From | To |
|------|-----|
| Centralized alerts | Community ownership |
| Passive consumers | Active stewards |
| External dependency | Local governance |

## The "Immune System" Theory
The community itself becomes the grid's **immune system**:
*   Youth as guardians against vandalism
*   Elders as validators of reports
*   Data as the shared source of truth

> "Data empowers leaders as an infrastructure 'immune system' against vandalism."
