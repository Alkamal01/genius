# Safro — Ground Truth

## The Discovery
The team began their journey in the markets of Zaria (Sabon Gari). Their initial assumption was that traders needed speed—a faster payment app.

## The Real Problem
Through deep listening—sitting on mats with onion dealers and drinking tea with union leaders—they uncovered a different reality:

> **"Speed wasn't the issue; Fear was."**

Traders like Malam Musa refused N400,000 orders from Lagos because of previous non-payment fraud.

## Root Cause Analysis
A **"Trust Deficit"** that freezes capital. Without a mechanism to verify distant buyers, trade remains hyper-local and inefficient.

## Key Research Insight
> "If we build a solution that only works on an iPhone with 4G, we exclude the very people who feed the nation."

This insight forced the team to look beyond just apps to the tools the market actually uses—basic feature phones and USSD.
