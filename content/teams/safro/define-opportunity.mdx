# Safro — Define Opportunity

## The Opportunity
Build the **trust layer for the informal economy** — connecting the dusty lanes of Zaria to the immutable ledger of Cardano.

## Market Size
*   **₦2.5 Trillion** — Estimated value of informal trade in Northern Nigeria
*   **72%** — Percentage of traders who have lost money to fraud
*   **85%** — Traders still using basic feature phones

## The Unlock
By creating a trust system that works on any phone:
*   **Frozen capital flows again** — Traders can accept orders from strangers
*   **Financial identity is born** — Transaction history becomes a credit score
*   **The unbanked get access** — Trade history on-chain unlocks future lending

## Regenerative Value
Beyond simple payments, this system creates **Financial Identity**. By recording valid transactions on-chain (via Atala PRISM), a trader's history becomes a "Trust Score," unlocking future access to credit for the unbanked.

## The Vision
> "We built a bridge, translating trust into a language Zaria understood."
