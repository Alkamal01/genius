## Phase B: Prototyping (The Pivot)

Our research led to a strategic pivot. We realized that a single platform would not suffice; we needed a **Dual-Interface Ecosystem** to bridge the gap between the informal and formal economies.

### The Innovation
Instead of forcing all users onto one platform, we built two access points to the same underlying system.

#### 1. For the Offline Trader (The "Sabon Gari" Interface)
*   **Technology:** USSD Escrow Gateway (*XYZ#).
*   **Accessibility:** Usable on any basic feature phone (e.g., Nokia 3310) via the GSM network, with no internet required.
*   **Function:** Allows traders to accept payments and confirm delivery via simple dial codes.

#### 2. For the Digital Native (The "ABU Student" Interface)
*   **Technology:** Multilingual Mobile App (Beta).
*   **Target:** Students and smartphone users.
*   **Function:** Visual dashboard, wallet management, and dispute initiation.

### Intelligibility
Both interfaces are fully **Multilingual (Hausa/English)**. We prioritize intelligibility to ensure that complex blockchain security is presented in simple, local language. This ensures users fully understand the terms of their transactions.
