# Safro — Formulate Hypothesis

## Core Hypothesis
> **"If we create a trust layer that works on both smartphones AND basic feature phones, we can unlock trade between strangers across the Northern Corridor."**

## The Dual-Interface Theory
The team hypothesized that a single blockchain-based escrow system could serve two completely different user types:

### For the Offline Trader (Feature Phone)
*   Access via USSD (*979#)
*   Works on Nokia 3310
*   No internet required
*   Hausa language support

### For the Digital Native (Smartphone)
*   Multilingual Mobile App
*   Modern UI/UX
*   Full feature set

## The Unifying Mechanism
Both interfaces connect to the same **"Invisible Guardian"** on the Cardano blockchain:
1. Buyer pays → Funds locked in escrow as stablecoin
2. Goods delivered → Verification by both parties
3. Confirmation → Guardian releases funds to seller

## Testable Prediction
> "A farmer with a Nokia 3310 can securely trade with a buyer in Lagos using the same trust layer as a student with an iPhone."
