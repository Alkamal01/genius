# Safro — Formulate Insight

## Key Research Insight

The team's interactions in Zaria led to a critical realization that challenged their initial assumptions about technology adoption.

> **"If we build a solution that only works on an iPhone with 4G, we exclude the very people who feed the nation."**

This insight forced us to admit our initial idea was limited. We had to look beyond "apps" to the tools the market actually uses.

### The Exclusion Problem
Most modern fintech solutions are built for smartphones. But in the informal markets of Northern Nigeria:
*   Users rely on basic feature phones (Nokia 3310s).
*   Data connectivity is unreliable.
*   Trust is built on face-to-face interaction, not digital abstraction.

**Conclusion:** To build true trust, we must build for the **lowest common denominator** of technology access.
