# Safro — Formulate Insight

## The Breakthrough Moment
After weeks of field research in Zaria's markets, the team had a critical realization:

> **"Speed wasn't the issue; Fear was."**

## The Insight
Traders weren't asking for faster payment apps. They were paralyzed by the fear of non-payment from distant, unknown buyers. Every large transaction carried the ghost of past fraud.

## What This Meant
1. **Trust is the bottleneck** — Not technology, not speed, not convenience
2. **The market is frozen** — Billions in potential trade never happens because traders stick to known, local buyers
3. **Existing solutions miss the mark** — Mobile money apps solve the wrong problem

## The Pivot
This insight forced a complete rethink. The team stopped building a "payment app" and started building a **"trust system"** that happens to move money.

> "We stopped trying to modernize the market and started serving it."
