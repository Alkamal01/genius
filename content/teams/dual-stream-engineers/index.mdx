## Product Journey

### Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The team's journey began in Zaria (Samaru Market) and Kaduna (Abidjan Dakar/Bamako Street). Their initial assumption was that the community's biggest struggles were electricity and water. However, by observing overflowing dumpsites and blocked drains, they realized the deeper issue was waste mismanagement affecting soil fertility and food security.

**The Problem:** Unmanaged waste poses significant environmental threats, including climate change acceleration from methane release, flooding from obstructed drainage, and contamination of terrestrial ecosystems.

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Research Insight:** "Waste is not garbage; it is a misplaced resource." The community is ready to act if given the right tools, not just lectures.

### Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
During the build phase, the team faced a major dilemma: How to separate plastic from organic waste? They initially considered high-tech solutions like AI-sensitive cameras and robotic arms. However, they pivoted to a low-tech, high-impact "2-in-1" bin.

**Top 3 Features:**
*   **Propeller Compositing Bin:** A mechanical bin where propellers serve as both a sieve to separate plastics and a turning tool for compost.
*   **Pyrolysis Unit:** A system that heats the separated plastics (in the absence of oxygen) to convert them into synthetic fuel.
*   **GreenToken Incentives:** A reward model where 1kg of waste earns ≈ ₦700 (1.33 ADA), turning waste collection into income.

### Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The final solution is a "GreenToken Ledger." It combines the physical processing of waste with a digital record book on Cardano.

**Technical Stack:** Physical Hardware (Sieving Bin/Pyrolysis), Cardano Blockchain (Transparency Ledger), Web Interface.

**Live Status:** Prototype demonstrated; Website live.

## Achievements & Reflections

The team's most significant achievement was the "Sustainable Pivot." By rejecting the complex AI robotic arm in favor of a mechanical propeller bin, they created a solution that the community can actually maintain.

**Key Milestone:** Successfully integrating a physical waste processing unit with a digital Cardano reward system (1kg = 1.33 ADA).

> [!TIP]
> **The "Big Lesson":** "We simplified features to make them easier to understand... shifting from 'cleaning up' to building a circular economy."
