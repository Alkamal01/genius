# Dual Stream Engineers — Define Opportunity

## The Opportunity
Transform **daily waste** into a **shared engine for community prosperity** through blockchain-verified incentives.

## The Problem Scale
*   **Overflowing dumpsites** across Zaria and Kaduna
*   **Blocked drains** causing flooding and disease
*   **Soil contamination** threatening food security

## The Unlock
By creating a circular economy:
*   **Organic waste → Compost** — Restored soil fertility
*   **Plastic waste → Fuel** — Energy for the community
*   **Participation → Income** — Economic incentive to clean up

## Regenerative Value
| Input | Output | Value |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1kg organic waste | Compost | Improved soil |
| 1kg plastic | Synthetic fuel | Energy |
| Collection effort | GreenTokens | ≈₦700 per kg |

## Vision
> "Turning daily waste into a shared engine for community prosperity."
