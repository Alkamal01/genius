# Dual Stream Engineers — Formulate Hypothesis

## Core Hypothesis
> **"If we combine simple mechanical waste separation with blockchain-verified rewards, we can transform daily waste into community income."**

## The 2-in-1 Bin Theory

### Layer 1: Propeller Compositing Bin
*   Propellers serve as sieve to separate plastics
*   Same propellers turn compost for aeration
*   Mechanical, no electricity needed

### Layer 2: Pyrolysis Unit
*   Heats separated plastics (absence of oxygen)
*   Converts to synthetic fuel
*   Closes the loop on plastic waste

### Layer 3: GreenToken Incentives
*   **1kg of waste = ≈₦700 (1.33 ADA)**
*   Turns waste collection into income
*   Verified on Cardano blockchain

## Testable Prediction
> "If community members can earn money for waste, they will actively collect and sort it—solving the separation problem through incentives rather than education."
