# Dual Stream Engineers — Formulate Insight

## The Breakthrough
High-tech solutions (AI cameras, robotic arms) would be impossible for the community to maintain.

## Key Insight
> "We simplified features to make them easier to understand... shifting from 'cleaning up' to building a circular economy."

## The Pivot
| From | To |
|------|-----|
| AI-powered sorting | Mechanical propeller bin |
| Complex robotics | Simple, maintainable hardware |
| External dependency | Community ownership |

## Why Low-Tech Wins
*   **Maintainable** — Community can fix it themselves
*   **Understandable** — No training required
*   **Sustainable** — Doesn't depend on external funding

## The Circular Economy Vision
Instead of just "cleaning up," the team saw an opportunity to create value:
*   Organic waste → Compost → Improved soil → Better food
*   Plastic waste → Pyrolysis → Fuel → Energy

> "Waste is not garbage; it is a misplaced resource."
