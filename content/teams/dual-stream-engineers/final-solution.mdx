# Dual Stream Engineers — Final Solution

## GreenToken Ledger

**"Turning daily waste into a shared engine for community prosperity."**

## The System

### Physical Processing
| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| Propeller Bin | Sieves plastic, turns compost |
| Pyrolysis Unit | Converts plastic to fuel |

### Digital Ledger

*   Every contributor gets paid, every kilo accounted for

### Incentive Structure
*   **1kg waste = ≈₦700 (1.33 ADA)**
*   Verified on blockchain
*   Transparent and tamper-proof

## Technical Stack
*   **Physical Hardware** — Sieving Bin, Pyrolysis Unit
*   **Cardano Blockchain** — Transparency Ledger
*   **Web Interface** — Contribution tracking

## Live Status
✅ Prototype demonstrated
✅ Website live

## Key Achievement
> Successfully integrating a physical waste processing unit with a digital Cardano reward system.

## The Big Lesson
> "We simplified features to make them easier to understand... shifting from 'cleaning up' to building a circular economy."
