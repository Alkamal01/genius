# Dual Stream Engineers — Ground Truth

## The Discovery
Initial assumption: electricity and water were the community's biggest struggles.

Reality: **Waste mismanagement** was the deeper issue affecting soil fertility and food security.

## What They Found
*   Overflowing dumpsites blocking drains
*   Soil contamination from hazardous leaching
*   Microbial imbalance and nutrient cycle inhibition
*   Flooding and disease from obstructed drainage

## The Problem
> "Unmanaged waste poses significant environmental threats, including climate change acceleration from methane release, flooding from obstructed drainage, and contamination of terrestrial ecosystems."

## The Surprising Truth
Residents weren't resisting change. They simply **lacked the tools** to separate waste effectively.

## Key Insight
> "Waste is not garbage; it is a misplaced resource."

The community was ready to act—they just needed the right tools, not lectures.
