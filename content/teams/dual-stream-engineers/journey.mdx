# Dual Stream Engineers — The Journey

## Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The team's journey began in Zaria (Samaru Market) and Kaduna (Abidjan Dakar/Bamako Street). Their initial assumption was that the community's biggest struggles were electricity and water.

However, by observing overflowing dumpsites and blocked drains, they realized the deeper issue was waste mismanagement affecting soil fertility and food security.

They discovered that residents weren't resisting change; they simply lacked the tools to separate waste.

## Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
The team faced a major dilemma: How to separate plastic from organic waste? They initially considered high-tech solutions like AI-sensitive cameras and robotic arms.

However, realizing that limited resources would make this unsustainable, they pivoted to a **low-tech, high-impact "2-in-1" bin**:
*   **Propeller Compositing Bin** — Separates plastics while turning compost
*   **Pyrolysis Unit** — Converts plastics to synthetic fuel
*   **GreenToken Incentives** — 1kg waste = ≈₦700 (1.33 ADA)

## Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The final solution is a "GreenToken Ledger" combining physical waste processing with a digital record book on Cardano. The system records waste input manually, then anchors data on-chain for transparency and trust.
