# MubaXpress — Formulate Insight

## The Breakthrough
The problem wasn't technology. The problem was **trust erosion**.

## Key Insight
> "Student vendors face an 'Identity Reset' every time they move. Years of building trust disappear overnight."

## The Trust Deficit
| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Identity Reset | Reputation can't carry over |
| Reliability Gap | Buyers can't verify sellers |
| Wasted Equity | Past good behavior counts for nothing |
| Stunted Growth | Vendors stay small to stay safe |

## The Platform Trap
Traditional marketplaces **extract** value—taking fees without building community capacity.

## The System Shift
The team shifted from building a "platform" to building a "system":
*   **Platform:** extracts value from transactions
*   **System:** circulates value, builds capacity

> "We stopped building a marketplace and started building a trust layer."
