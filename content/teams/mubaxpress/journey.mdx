# Team Linx — MubaXpress Journey

## Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The team began with a vague mandate to "walk and pay attention." They initially assumed the problem was a lack of a modern marketplace app.

However, through deep listening, the Weavers discovered that the real issue was **invisibility**. Student vendors like Ibrahim and Hauwa had products, but they lacked a portable reputation. Every time they moved locations, their trust reset to zero.

Simultaneously, buyers were relying on chaotic WhatsApp groups where scams were common.

## Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
The pivotal moment occurred when Nimah wandered into the campus Post Office—a massive, underutilized facility from the 1970s.

The team realized they didn't need to build a new logistics network; they needed to **"awaken"** this sleeping giant.

They designed a **Tri-Layer System:**
1. **Digital:** A marketplace for visibility (prioritizing used textbooks)
2. **Physical:** The Post Office acts as the verification hub
3. **Trust (Blockchain):** Using Cardano to mint "Reputation Badges" as NFTs

## Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The final build is a fully functional "Regenerative System" connecting a React-based frontend to a Cardano-powered backend. The system is live, allowing students to list products while the backend logic prepares to mint reputation badges on the mainnet.
