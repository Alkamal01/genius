# MubaXpress — Formulate Hypothesis

## Core Hypothesis
> **"If we combine existing physical infrastructure (Post Office) with blockchain reputation (NFT badges), we can create a portable, permanent trust layer for student commerce."**

## The Tri-Layer Theory

### Layer 1: Digital
*   Online marketplace for visibility
*   Focus on used textbooks (high demand, low trust)
*   Mobile-first interface

### Layer 2: Physical
*   Post Office as verification hub
*   Staff check goods before handoff
*   Student couriers for last-mile delivery

### Layer 3: Trust (Blockchain)
*   Reputation Badges minted as NFTs on Cardano
*   Bronze → Silver → Gold based on successful deliveries
*   Permanent and portable (survives graduation)

## The Cold Start Solution
New vendors get a "New Vendor Boost" to help them earn first verified reviews.

## Testable Prediction
> "A vendor with a Gold badge on-chain can command higher prices and attract more buyers than an unknown seller."
