# MubaXpress — Ground Truth

## The Discovery
The team initially assumed student vendors needed a modern marketplace app. Through deep listening, they discovered the real issue: **invisibility**.

## What They Found
*   Student vendors had products but **no portable reputation**
*   Every location change meant **trust reset to zero**
*   Buyers relied on **chaotic WhatsApp groups** with frequent scams

## The Root Problem
> "We aren't building a marketplace; we are building a trust system. The marketplace is just the interface."

## The Sleeping Giant
The pivotal moment came when Nimah wandered into the campus Post Office—a massive, underutilized facility from the 1970s.

*   **Built for:** handling thousands of packages
*   **Current state:** sitting mostly empty
*   **Opportunity:** verification hub for all campus commerce

## Key Insight
> "Innovation isn't always about inventing something new. Sometimes it's about having the humility to awaken what is sleeping."
