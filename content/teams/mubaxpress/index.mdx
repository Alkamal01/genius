## Product Journey

### Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The team began with a vague mandate to "walk and pay attention." They initially assumed the problem was a lack of a modern marketplace app. However, through deep listening, the Weavers discovered that the real issue was **invisibility**. Student vendors had products, but they lacked a portable reputation.

**The Problem:** Student vendors face an "Erosion of Trust" because "Identity Reset" prevents reputation carry-over, creating a "Reliability Gap," "Wasted Equity," and "Stunted Growth."

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Research Insight:** "We aren't building a marketplace; we are building a trust system. The marketplace is just the interface."

### Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
The pivotal moment occurred when Nimah wandered into the campus Post Office—a massive, underutilized facility from the 1970s. The team realized they didn't need to build a new logistics network; they needed to "awaken" this sleeping giant.

**They designed a Tri-Layer System:**
1.  **Digital:** A marketplace for visibility (prioritizing used textbooks).
2.  **Physical:** The Post Office acts as the verification hub where goods are checked.
3.  **Trust (Blockchain):** Using Cardano to mint "Reputation Badges" (Bronze, Silver, Gold) as NFTs.

**Top 3 Features:**
*   **Post Office Verification Hub:** Utilizing existing university infrastructure to verify transactions.
*   **NFT Trust Badges:** Immutable reputation credentials on Cardano based on successful delivery counts.
*   **New Vendor Boost:** A "Cold Start" solution that highlights new sellers.

### Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The final build is a fully functional "Regenerative System" connecting a React-based frontend to a Cardano-powered backend.

**Technical Stack:** React (Frontend), Node.js (Backend), Cardano (Atala PRISM/NFTs for Identity), Vercel (Deployment).

**Live Status:** Prototype deployed; Post Office partnership proposal under review.

## Achievements & Reflections

Team Linx's greatest achievement was the shift in thinking from "Platform" (extracting value) to "System" (circulating value).

**Key Milestone:** Successfully designing the "Badge Logic" where physical deliveries at the Post Office trigger on-chain reputation minting.

> [!TIP]
> **The "Big Lesson":** "Innovation isn't always about inventing something new. Sometimes it's about having the humility to awaken what is sleeping."
