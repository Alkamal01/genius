1. **Current stage** — Ground, Define, Prototype, Test, or Reflect
2. **Short 1-line status update** — What did you do this week?
3. **Required deliverable for next check-in** — Specific items needed
4. **Next meeting date/time and contact** — When and how to reach you

## 💡 Tips for Effective Progress Tracking

### Keep Status Updates Specific

✅ **Good:**
> "Tested payment system with 15 vendors. 13/15 successfully sent ₦50 via SMS. Learned we need clearer instructions."

❌ **Too vague:**
> "Did some testing. It went well."

### Document Everything

✅ **Good practice:**
- Take photos during every field visit
- Record quotes immediately
- Upload evidence same day
- Update discovery log weekly

❌ **Poor practice:**
- Wait until deadline to document
- Rely on memory for quotes
- Skip photo documentation

### Be Honest About Challenges

✅ **Good:**
> "Prototype failed during testing. Users couldn't understand SMS codes. Pivoting to simpler number system."

❌ **Poor:**
> "Everything is perfect!" (when it's not)
