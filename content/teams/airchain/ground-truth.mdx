# AirChain — Ground Truth

## The Discovery
Communities in Uyo self-organize around **visible** problems—overflowing waste bins, failed water supply, broken roads. But they ignore air pollution.

## Why?
Air pollution is **invisible**. There's no shared signal to coordinate action.

## The Problem
*   **Delayed health effects** — Lung damage takes years to manifest
*   **Abstract risks** — Hard to prioritize what you can't see
*   **Missing data** — Policymakers lack public urgency and definitive evidence

## Traditional Approach (Rejected)
The team initially considered deploying sensors that report data to a central dashboard. But they realized:

> "Machine-like systems are fragile. They degrade silently when funding or attention fades."

## Key Research Insight
> "Communities act when information flows **through** them, not **at** them."

This insight shifted the approach from a rigid machine to a **Living System**—one that grows with the community rather than depending on external maintenance.
