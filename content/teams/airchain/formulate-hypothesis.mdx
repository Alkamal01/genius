# AirChain — Formulate Hypothesis

## Core Hypothesis
> **"If we design sensors as 'Cells' in a living system—with resilience, incentives, and community ownership—we can make air quality visible and actionable."**

## The Living System Theory
Instead of traditional "deploy and forget" sensors, AirChain hypothesized a biological approach:

### Sensors as "Cells"
*   **Resilient** — Buffer data during outages, sync when network recovers
*   **Autonomous** — Don't depend on central control
*   **Self-healing** — Network continues even when individual nodes fail

### Merkle Batching for Truth
*   Hash readings into a Merkle tree
*   Anchor only the Root on Cardano
*   Prove vast amounts of data with a single on-chain hash

### AIRQ Token for Stewardship
*   Pre-minted supply: 1 Billion
*   Rewards community members who maintain hardware
*   Creates sustainable incentive loop

## Testable Prediction
> "Students will alter their routes based on air quality data. Communities will organize around specific evidence rather than vague concerns."
