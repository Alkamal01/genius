## Product Journey

### Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The team observed a stark contrast in Uyo: communities self-organize around visible problems like overflowing waste bins or failed water supply, but they ignore air pollution because it is invisible. There was no "shared signal" to coordinate action.

**The Problem:** Air pollution's delayed and abstract health effects impede effective action. Residents struggle to prioritize long-term risks, and policymakers lack the public urgency and definitive data needed for stringent regulations.

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Research Insight:** "Communities act when information flows through them, not at them... We shifted from a rigid machine to a Living System."

### Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
To build a "Living System," AirChain designed sensors as "Cells"—autonomous nodes that tolerate intermittent power and connectivity loss. They implemented Merkle Batching for data integrity.

**Top 3 Features:**
*   **Resilient Nodes:** Sensors that buffer data during outages and sync when the network recovers.
*   **Merkle Data Anchoring:** Efficiently proving the existence of vast amounts of environmental data using a single on-chain hash.
*   **AIRQ Token:** A pre-minted token (Supply: 1B) designed to incentivize stewardship and maintenance of the physical hardware.

### Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The system is fully operational on the Cardano Preprod Testnet. The backend uses FastAPI and Kubernetes for orchestration.

**Technical Stack:** FastAPI (Python), Kubernetes, MQTT (Ingestion), Cardano (Aiken/Plutus v3), PostgreSQL.

**Live Status:** Operational; Validator deployed on Preprod; AIRQ Tokens minted.

## Achievements & Reflections

AirChain's success lies in its "Regenerative Loop." By making air quality visible, they shifted local conversations from vague concerns to specific evidence.

**Key Milestone:** Successful deployment of the "Environmental Data Anchor Validator" on Cardano Preprod.

> [!TIP]
> **The "Big Lesson":** "Like living systems, AirChain does not aim for static optimization. It aims for resilient, regenerative continuity."
