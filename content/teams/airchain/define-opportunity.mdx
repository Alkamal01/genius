# AirChain — Define Opportunity

## The Opportunity
Make **invisible air pollution visible** through a community-operated sensor network anchored on Cardano.

## The Problem Scale
*   **7 million deaths/year** — Global air pollution mortality
*   **Zero visibility** — Communities can't see what's killing them
*   **No coordination** — Policymakers lack data, public lacks urgency

## The Unlock
By making air quality visible and verifiable:
*   **Conversations shift** — From vague concerns to specific evidence
*   **Behavior changes** — Students alter routes based on real data
*   **Policy improves** — Policymakers get the evidence they need

## The Regenerative Loop
Unlike traditional monitoring that creates dependency:
*   Sensors designed as **community assets**
*   AIRQ tokens **incentivize maintenance**
*   Data flows **through** community, not at them

## Vision
> "A community-operated system making air quality visible, verifiable, and self-sustaining by anchoring truth on Cardano."
