# AirChain — The Journey

## Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The team observed a stark contrast in Uyo: communities self-organize around visible problems like overflowing waste bins or failed water supply, but they ignore air pollution because it is invisible.

There was no "shared signal" to coordinate action. The team initially considered a traditional "machine-like" system (deploy sensors -> report data), but realized these systems are fragile—they degrade silently when funding or attention fades.

## Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
To build a "Living System," AirChain designed sensors as "Cells"—autonomous nodes that tolerate intermittent power and connectivity loss.

Crucially, they implemented **Merkle Batching** for data integrity. Instead of spamming the blockchain with raw data, the system hashes readings into a Merkle tree and anchors only the Root on Cardano.

This ensures privacy, efficiency, and verifiable truth without bloating the chain.

## Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The system is fully operational on the Cardano Preprod Testnet. The backend uses FastAPI and Kubernetes for orchestration, ensuring scalability.

An Aiken Validator enforces the integrity of the data anchors, treating Cardano as "immutable public memory" rather than a computation engine.
