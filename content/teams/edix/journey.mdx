# Edix — The Journey

## Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The team's research in Zaria revealed that a student's academic history is often "trapped" in paper files or proprietary databases.

When students move schools or apply for jobs, their history is difficult to prove, easy to forge, and expensive to retrieve.

The key insight was that efficient Web2 tools alone just create "better silos"—true impact requires transforming academic data from a school liability into a **sovereign student asset**.

## Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
To solve the workload issue, Edix built a "High-Performance Engine" prioritizing speed and automation:
*   **The Brain (Backend):** FastAPI with Google Gemini AI
*   **The Interface (Frontend):** React 19 + TypeScript
*   **The Trust Layer:** PyCardano & Blockfrost for credential minting

## Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The final implementation demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a "Grade VC." When a teacher finalizes a grade, the system automatically triggers the school's DID to issue a tamper-proof credential to the student's wallet.

This moves the project from a simple management tool to a **Digital Rights Platform** for students.
