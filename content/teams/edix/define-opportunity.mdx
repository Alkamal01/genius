## The Opportunity
Transform **school data into sovereign student assets** through AI-powered automation and blockchain verification.

## The Problem Scale

*   **Weeks** for typical verification processes
*   **Easy forgery** with no cryptographic proof

## The Unlock
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| School owns | Student owns |
| Paper only | Digital + Paper |
| Manual verification | Instant on-chain proof |
| Location-bound | Globally portable |

## Business Model
*   **Schools:** Pay for reduced admin burden
*   **Students:** Own their credentials forever
*   **Employers:** Instant verification

## Regenerative Value
Not just better databases—**better ownership models** that give students control of their educational identity.
