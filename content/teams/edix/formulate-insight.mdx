# Edix — Formulate Insight

## The Breakthrough
Efficiency isn't enough. Better databases don't solve the ownership problem.

## Key Insight
> "We cannot just build better databases; we must build better ownership models."

## The Shift
| From | To |
|------|-----|
| School owns records | Student owns records |
| Paper transcripts | Verifiable Credentials |
| Request and wait | Instant verification |
| Forgeable documents | Cryptographic proof |

## Why Ownership Matters
*   **Portability** — Records follow the student
*   **Permanence** — No fire, flood, or error can erase
*   **Sovereignty** — Student controls access

## The Vision
A student in Zaria owns a verified, portable record of their hard work that can be instantly verified by any employer or institution worldwide.

> "If a student owns their data via a DID, they become the custodian of their own future."
