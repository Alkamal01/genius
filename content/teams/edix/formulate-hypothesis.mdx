# Edix — Formulate Hypothesis

## Core Hypothesis
> **"If we automatically mint academic credentials as Verifiable Credentials on Cardano, students will own portable, tamper-proof records of their education."**

## The Technical Theory

### Layer 1: High-Performance Engine
*   **FastAPI** — Async speed for handling many users
*   **Google Gemini AI** — Automates grading and NLP input
*   **Celery + Redis** — Background job processing

### Layer 2: Document Engine
*   Generates physical paper reports (parents still expect them)
*   Bridges digital and physical worlds

### Layer 3: Invisible Trust Layer
*   **PyCardano & Blockfrost** — Mints VCs in background
*   **Twilio** — SMS notifications to parents without smartphones

## The Automatic Trigger
When a teacher clicks "Finalize Grade":
1. Grade saved to database
2. VC automatically generated
3. School's DID signs credential
4. Credential sent to student's wallet

## Testable Prediction
> "A graduate with on-chain credentials will get verified 10x faster than one with paper transcripts."
