## Product Journey

### Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The team's research in Zaria revealed that a student's academic history is often "trapped" in paper files or proprietary databases. When students move schools or apply for jobs, their history is difficult to prove, easy to forge, and expensive to retrieve.

**The Potential:** The current fragmented academic record system scatters student histories across institutions. This leads to incomplete records, loss of identity, and manual re-verification.

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Research Insight:** If a student owns their data via a Decentralized Identifier (DID), they become the custodian of their own future, not the school.

### Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
To solve the workload issue, Edix built a "High-Performance Engine" prioritizing speed and automation.

*   **The Brain (Backend):** Built on FastAPI (Python) for asynchronous speed, using Google Gemini as the AI core.
*   **The Interface (Frontend):** React 19 + TypeScript for a reliable user experience.
*   **The "Invisible" Trust Layer:** PyCardano & Blockfrost handle the minting of academic records as verifiable credentials.

**Top 3 Features:**
*   **AI-Powered Automation:** Google Gemini integration for "Active Assistance" in grading and NLP input.
*   **Async Report Generation:** Celery & Redis background tasks ensure the system remains fast.
*   **Hybrid Communication:** Bridging high-tech blockchain records with low-tech SMS notifications for parents.

### Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The final implementation demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a "Grade VC." When a teacher finalizes a grade, the system automatically triggers the school's DID to issue a tamper-proof credential to the student's wallet.

**Technical Stack:** FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL, Atala PRISM (SSI), React.

**Live Status:** MVP demonstrating VC issuance upon grade finalization.

## Achievements & Reflections

The team's biggest shift was realizing that efficiency wasn't enough. The true achievement was proving that a student in Zaria can own a verified, portable record of their hard work that no fire, flood, or bureaucratic error can erase.

**Key Milestone:** Successful integration of Atala PRISM to issue the first set of academic Verifiable Credentials.

> [!TIP]
> **The "Big Lesson":** "We cannot just build better databases; we must build better ownership models."
