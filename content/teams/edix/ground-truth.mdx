# Edix — Ground Truth

## The Discovery
Academic records are "trapped"—in paper files, proprietary databases, or single institutions.

## The Problems
*   **Difficult to prove** — Students can't easily verify their history
*   **Easy to forge** — No cryptographic verification
*   **Expensive to retrieve** — Fees for transcripts and verification

## What Happens When Students Move
| Scenario | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Transfer schools | Records don't follow |
| Apply for jobs | Verification takes weeks |
| Lose paper copies | History disappears |

## The Insight
> "Efficient Web2 tools just create 'better silos.' True impact requires transforming academic data from a school liability into a sovereign student asset."

## The Key Question
> "If a student owns their data via a Decentralized Identifier (DID), they become the custodian of their own future, not the school."
