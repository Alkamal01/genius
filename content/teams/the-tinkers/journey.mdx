# The Tinkers — T-Medic Journey

## Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The Tinkers team identified a critical vulnerability in the current healthcare system: medical records are often stored on paper or in centralized databases that are prone to loss, alteration, or compromise.

The research highlighted that when a patient's history is tampered with, it isn't just a data breach—it is a **direct threat to patient safety**.

The team realized that trust in medical data should not depend on a single administrator but on an **immutable standard of truth**.

## Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
The team built T-Medic, a platform that functions as a "Digital Notary."

The prototype adopts a hybrid approach:
*   Patient records stored securely in a standard database (accessibility)
*   Unique "digital fingerprint" (hash) generated for verification
*   Fingerprints anchored on Cardano blockchain (truth)

## Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The transparent, immutable certification process ensures a fully auditable and tamper-proof record. Users can "Certify on Cardano" with one click, generating a verification link that anyone can use to audit the record.
