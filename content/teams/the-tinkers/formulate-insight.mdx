# The Tinkers — Formulate Insight

## The Breakthrough
Medical records need to be both **accessible** and **immutable**—two traits that usually conflict.

## Key Insight
> "Blockchain is not just for finance; it is a tool for integrity."

## The Hybrid Approach
| Need | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Accessibility | Standard database |
| Immutability | Blockchain hash |
| Privacy | Off-chain storage |
| Truth | On-chain anchor |

## Why a "Digital Notary"
Like a traditional notary certifies documents, T-Medic certifies medical records:
*   Original stays with provider
*   Fingerprint (hash) goes on-chain
*   Any tampering invalidates the proof

## The Standard for Truth
> "T-Medic is not just a website; it is a standard for medical truth—where patient safety is guaranteed by code, not just policy."
