# The Tinkers — Formulate Hypothesis

## Core Hypothesis
> **"If we create a 'Digital Notary' that anchors medical record fingerprints on Cardano, we can ensure tamper-proof patient history without sacrificing accessibility."**

## The Certification Flow

### Step 1: Data Entry
*   Healthcare provider enters accurate record
*   Record stored in secure off-chain database

### Step 2: Certify on Cardano
*   User clicks "Certify"
*   Unique hash generated from record
*   Hash embedded in Cardano transaction metadata

### Step 3: Verification
*   Anyone can verify via Cardanoscan
*   Compare fingerprint to current record
*   Mismatch = tampering detected

## Testable Prediction
> "A hospital using T-Medic will catch 100% of record tampering attempts, compared to 0% detection with traditional systems."

## Why Cardano?
*   Native metadata capabilities
*   Low fees
*   Peer-reviewed blockchain
*   Energy efficient
