# Safro — Ground Truth

## Phase A: Ground Potentializing (The Discovery)

The team began their journey in the markets of Zaria (Sabon Gari) with the assumption that traders needed speed—specifically, a faster payment app. However, thorough engagement with the community, including *979#s and union leaders, revealed a different reality.

### The Specific Friction
**Speed was not the primary issue. The real barrier was fear.**

We met traders like **Malam Musa**, who refused orders worth N400,000 from Lagos due to previous experiences with non-payment fraud.

### The Root Cause
The core problem is a **Trust Deficit** that freezes capital. Without a reliable mechanism to verify valid buyers from a distance, trade remains hyper-local and inefficient. The fear of fraud outweighs the potential for profit, keeping the market disconnected.
