# The Tinkers — Ground Truth

## The Discovery
Medical records are vulnerable—stored on paper or in centralized databases prone to loss, alteration, or compromise.

## The Risks
| Risk | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| Paper records | Fire, flood, misfiling |
| Centralized DB | Single point of failure |
| No audit trail | Tampering goes undetected |
| Fragmentation | History scattered across providers |

## The Real Problem
> "When a patient's history is tampered with, it isn't just a data breach—it is a direct threat to patient safety."

## Why Trust Matters
*   Wrong medication could be prescribed
*   Allergies could be missed
*   Surgical history could be unknown
*   Insurance fraud becomes easy

## Key Insight
> "Trust in medical data should not depend on a single administrator but on an immutable standard of truth."
