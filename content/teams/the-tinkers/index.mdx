## Product Journey

### Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The Tinkers team identified a critical vulnerability in the current healthcare system: medical records are often stored on paper or in centralized databases that are prone to loss, alteration, or compromise.

**The Problem:** Centralized, paper medical records pose significant security risks from easy tampering (lack of audit trail enables fraud) and high loss vulnerability (fire, flood, misfiling, fragmentation).

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Research Insight:** "The risk goes beyond data; it is a threat to patient safety."

### Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
The team built T-Medic, a platform that functions as a "Digital Notary." The prototype adopts a hybrid approach: patient records are stored securely in a standard database for accessibility, but a unique "digital fingerprint" (hash) is generated for verification.

**Top 3 Features:**
*   **Hybrid Storage:** Secure off-chain database for privacy, on-chain anchoring for truth.
*   **"Certify on Cardano":** One-click wallet signature to mint record proofs.
*   **Tamper Flagging:** Immediate invalidation if the current record does not match the blockchain fingerprint.

### Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The transparent, immutable certification process ensures a fully auditable and tamper-proof record.

**Technical Stack:** Fullstack Web, Cardano Blockchain (Metadata/Transaction), Wallet Integration.

**Live Status:** Functional MVP on Cardano Preprod Testnet.

## Achievements & Reflections

Team Tinkers proved that blockchain is not just for finance; it is a tool for integrity. By successfully integrating the full stack to verify medical history, they have established a new standard for medical truth.

**Key Milestone:** Successful on-chain anchoring of medical record metadata via wallet signature.

> [!TIP]
> **The "Big Lesson":** "T-Medic is not just a website; it is a standard for medical truth."
