# Team Kurama — Define Opportunity

## The Opportunity
Transform **invisible community labor** into **visible, verifiable, fundable impact** on the Cardano blockchain.

## The Problem Scope
*   **3,000+ households** affected by blocked drainage in Samaru
*   **Malaria cases up 40%** in areas with stagnant water
*   **Zero formal recognition** for community cleanup efforts

## The Unlock
By creating a "Proof of Impact" system:
*   **Green credits become possible** — Verifiable environmental work
*   **NGO funding unlocked** — Donors can see exactly where money goes
*   **Community pride restored** — Invisible labor becomes visible

## The Stewardship Circle
A human governance layer of elders and health workers who use the data to:
*   Direct cleaning efforts to worst-affected areas
*   Allocate resources based on verified contributions
*   Build community-owned decision-making infrastructure

## Vision
> "Restoring flow and vitality through community-led waste intelligence."
