## Product Journey

### Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The journey began with a deep immersion into the streets of Samaru. Team Kurama walked the community to observe the "veins" of the town—its drainage systems. They found these veins clogged with plastic and debris, leading to stagnant water and a surge in preventable diseases like Malaria and Typhoid.

**The Potential:** Blocked drainage causes severe urban flooding and public health crises. Stagnant water spreads vector-borne illnesses.

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Research Insight:** The community is already practicing "informal regeneration"—children carry waste to collection points, and locals repurpose decomposed waste as fertilizer.

### Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
The team built a system that meets the community where they are: **USSD**. Using Africa's Talking, they created a simple interface that works on any basic mobile phone.

**Top 3 Features:**
*   **USSD Logger:** An offline-first interface (*384*2007#) accessible to any "Small Boy" with a basic phone.
*   **Double-Witness Verification:** Human-to-digital validation that ensures data integrity before it hits the blockchain.
*   **The Stewardship Circle:** A human governance layer of elders and health workers who use the data to direct cleaning efforts.

### Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The final step was anchoring this "informal labor" to a global standard. By connecting the USSD backend to the Cardano blockchain (via Blockfrost API), every verified bag of waste becomes an immutable digital asset.

**Technical Stack:** USSD (Africa's Talking), Cardano Blockchain (Blockfrost API), Admin Dashboard (Decision Intelligence).

**Live Status:** Functional Pilot; "Narrative Infrastructure" active.

## Achievements & Reflections

Team Kurama's victory was in restraint. They didn't build a complex app that no one would use; they built a "digital mirror" (USSD) that reflected the community's own value back to them.

**Key Milestone:** Successfully bridging a basic USSD phone interaction to an immutable Cardano blockchain transaction.

> [!TIP]
> **The "Big Lesson":** "When you actually listen to the ground before you build, you don't just create an app, you help a system find its flow."
