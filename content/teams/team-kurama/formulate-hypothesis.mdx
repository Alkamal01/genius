# Team Kurama — Formulate Hypothesis

## Core Hypothesis
> **"If we make informal waste collection visible and verifiable on the blockchain, we can transform a daily chore into a fundable, creditworthy community asset."**

## The Double-Witness Theory
To ensure data integrity without complex technology, the team hypothesized a two-layer validation:

### Layer 1: Digital Log (Collector)
*   Any "Small Boy" with a basic phone dials *384*2007#
*   Logs bags collected, location, and time
*   Data stored in temporary buffer

### Layer 2: Physical Validation (Hub Coordinator)
*   Hub coordinator confirms physical delivery
*   Matches digital log to actual bags
*   Only then does record become permanent

## Testable Prediction
> "If a child can dial a USSD code on a Nokia, and a coordinator can verify delivery, we can create an immutable blockchain record of community impact."

## Why This Works
*   **Trust without complexity** — Human verification catches errors
*   **Accessible to all** — No smartphone required
*   **On-chain proof** — Permanent record for future funding
