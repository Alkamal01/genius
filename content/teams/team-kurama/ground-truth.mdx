# Team Kurama — Ground Truth

## The Discovery
Deep immersion into the streets of Samaru revealed a failing circulatory system—the community's drainage was clogged with plastic and debris.

## What They Found
*   **Stagnant water pools** breeding mosquitoes
*   **Surge in preventable diseases** — Malaria, Typhoid
*   **Blocked veins** — Drainage systems overwhelmed

## The Surprising Truth
The residents weren't the problem. The community already practiced **"informal regeneration"**:
*   Children carry waste to collection points
*   Locals repurpose decomposed waste as fertilizer
*   Elders organize periodic cleanup efforts

## The Real Bottleneck
The lack of a **supportive infrastructure** was the issue. There was no system to:
*   Track contributions
*   Reward consistent effort
*   Make invisible labor visible

> "We realized the residents weren't resisting change—they lacked the tools to coordinate action."
