# Team Kurama — The Journey

## Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The journey began with a deep immersion into the streets of Samaru. Rather than approaching as "outside experts," Team Kurama walked the community to observe the "veins" of the town—its drainage systems.

They found these veins clogged with plastic and debris, leading to stagnant water and a surge in preventable diseases like Malaria and Typhoid.

Through conversations with elders, youths, and healthcare workers, the team discovered a "culture of care" that was being stifled by a broken system.

## Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
The team built a system that meets the community where they are: **USSD**. Using Africa's Talking, they created a simple interface that works on any basic mobile phone, allowing collectors to log deliveries with a few keystrokes.

To ensure truth, they implemented a **"Double-Witness Protocol"**: a digital log by the collector must be physically validated by a hub coordinator before it becomes a permanent record.

## Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The final step was anchoring this "informal labor" to a global standard. By connecting the USSD backend to the Cardano blockchain (via Blockfrost API), every verified bag of waste becomes an immutable digital asset.

This transforms a daily chore into a **"Proof of Impact"**—creating a verifiable history that can unlock future funding and green credits for the community.
