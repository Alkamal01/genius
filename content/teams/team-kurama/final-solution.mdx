# Team Kurama — Final Solution

## The Veins of Samaru

**"Restoring flow and vitality through community-led waste intelligence."**

## The System

### USSD Logger (*384*2007#)
*   Works on any basic phone (Nokia 3310 compatible)
*   Accessible to any "Small Boy" in the community
*   Offline-first — buffers data during network outages

### Double-Witness Verification
| Step | Actor | Action |
|------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Collector | Dials USSD, logs collection |
| 2 | Hub Coordinator | Physically confirms delivery |
| 3 | System | Only then anchors to blockchain |

### The Stewardship Circle
*   Elders and health workers as governance layer
*   Data-driven decisions on resource allocation
*   Community-owned infrastructure

## Technical Stack
*   **USSD** — Africa's Talking
*   **Cardano** — Blockfrost API for anchoring
*   **Admin Dashboard** — Decision Intelligence interface

## Live Status
✅ Functional Pilot active
✅ "Narrative Infrastructure" operational
✅ USSD to blockchain pipeline working

## Key Achievement
> Successfully bridging a basic USSD phone interaction to an immutable Cardano blockchain transaction.
