# Team Kurama — Formulate Insight

## The Breakthrough
The community was already doing the work. They just couldn't prove it.

## Key Insight
> "Informal labor is invisible labor. If you can't measure it, you can't value it. If you can't value it, you can't fund it."

## What This Meant
1. **The infrastructure exists** — Children, elders, and volunteers already collect waste
2. **The problem is visibility** — No record of who contributes, how much, or when
3. **Technology should mirror, not replace** — The solution must reflect the community's existing efforts back to them

## The Pivot
Instead of building a complex app that nobody would use, the team decided to build a **"digital mirror"** using the simplest possible interface: USSD.

> "When you actually listen to the ground before you build, you don't just create an app, you help a system find its flow."
