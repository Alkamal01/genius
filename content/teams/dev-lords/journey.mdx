# Dev-Lords — Turawa Trust Foundation Journey

## Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The team grounded their work in the paradox of Nigeria: a culture rich in generosity but plagued by skepticism.

Through visits to low-income villages and conversations with lapsed donors, they discovered a "Trust Loop" that was broken. Donors had stopped giving not because they didn't care, but because they lacked **peace of mind**.

## Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
The team initially built a system to track donations **in**. However, a critical reflection session led to a major pivot.

They realized that seeing money enter an NGO's wallet wasn't enough; the real black box was how it **left**.

They expanded the prototype to track withdrawals and distributions:
*   Purpose-Tagged Withdrawals
*   Immutable Audit Trail
*   Transparency Dashboard

## Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The final deployment is a "Living System" for restoring dignity. It provides a technical layer of accountability that allows honest NGOs to prove their work and allows donors to give with confidence.

The system utilizes Cardano blockchain to make records permanent, ensuring donation history can never be altered.
