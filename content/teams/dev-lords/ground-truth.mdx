# Dev-Lords — Ground Truth

## The Discovery
Nigeria has a culture rich in generosity. But donors have stopped giving.

## Why?
> "Donors want to help but lack peace of mind... blind trust is no longer sufficient."

## What They Found
Through visits to low-income villages and conversations with lapsed donors:

| Finding | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| No fund visibility | Donors can't verify usage |
| Fear of mismanagement | Giving decreases |
| High admin costs | Trust erodes |
| No impact metrics | Skepticism grows |

## The Broken Trust Loop
*   Donor gives → NGO receives → **Black box** → Unknown outcome
*   Result: Donors stop giving entirely

## The Key Insight
The problem isn't **in**—it's **out**. Donors can see money entering, but not how it leaves.

> "The real black box was how funds left the NGO, not how they entered."
