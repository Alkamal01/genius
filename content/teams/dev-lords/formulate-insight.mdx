# Dev-Lords — Formulate Insight

## The Breakthrough
Tracking donations **in** isn't enough. The real opacity is in **distribution**.

## Key Insight
> "Technology's role isn't just to move money—it's to **witness** it."

## The Pivot
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Track donations in | Track distributions out |
| Trust the NGO | Verify the process |
| Opaque operations | Transparent audit trail |

## Why Witnessing Matters
*   **Donors see impact** — Follow the money to beneficiaries
*   **NGOs prove integrity** — Honest orgs can show their work
*   **Bad actors exposed** — No place to hide misuse

## The Trust Restoration Loop
Transparency → Accountability → Trust → More Participation → Greater Impact

> "Transparency creates accountability, accountability restores trust, and trust increases participation."
