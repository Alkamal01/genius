# Dev-Lords — Formulate Hypothesis

## Core Hypothesis
> **"If we make every withdrawal purpose-tagged and record it immutably on-chain, donors will regain confidence and giving will increase."**

## The Transparency System

### Purpose-Tagged Withdrawals
*   No withdrawal without declared purpose
*   Every expense categorized and explained
*   Funds can't move silently

### Immutable Audit Trail
*   When funds received → On-chain
*   When funds distributed → On-chain
*   Where funds went → On-chain

### Donor Dashboard
*   "Follow the money" interface
*   See journey from wallet to beneficiary
*   Real-time verification

## Testable Prediction
> "NGOs using transparent blockchain tracking will see 50%+ increase in donor retention compared to traditional reporting."

## The Living System
Not just tracking—**witnessing**. Creating a technical layer of accountability that scales poverty alleviation.
