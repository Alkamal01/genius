# Dev-Lords — Define Opportunity

## The Opportunity
Replace **blind trust** with **verifiable proof** in the Nigerian philanthropy sector.

## The Problem Scale
*   **₦Billions** donated annually
*   **Declining trust** in NGOs
*   **No visibility** into fund usage

## The Unlock
| Donor Pain Point | Solution |
|------------------|----------|
| "Where did my money go?" | Follow-the-money dashboard |
| "Is the NGO legit?" | On-chain audit trail |
| "Was it spent correctly?" | Purpose-tagged withdrawals |

## Who Benefits
*   **Donors:** Peace of mind, increased giving
*   **Honest NGOs:** Proof of integrity
*   **Beneficiaries:** More aid reaches them

## Regenerative Value
By making the "invisible visible," this system can scale poverty alleviation efforts across Nigeria.

## Vision
> "Replacing blind trust with verifiable proof: A transparent donation & distribution system."
