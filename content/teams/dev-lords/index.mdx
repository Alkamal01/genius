## Product Journey

### Phase A: Ground Potentializing (Research & Ideation)
The team grounded their work in the paradox of Nigeria: a culture rich in generosity but plagued by skepticism. Through visits to low-income villages and conversations with lapsed donors, they discovered a "Trust Loop" that was broken.

**The Problem:** Donor trust in NGOs is declining due to the inability to verify how funds are used. This lack of verifiable financial reports and impact metrics erodes confidence and disincentivizes giving.

> [!NOTE]
> **Key Research Insight:** "Donors want to help but lack peace of mind... blind trust is no longer sufficient."

### Phase B: Prototyping (Design & Development)
The team initially built a system to track donations in. However, a critical internal reflection session led to a major Pivot. They realized that seeing money enter an NGO's wallet wasn't enough; the real black box was how it **left**.

**Top 3 Features:**
*   **Purpose-Tagged Withdrawals:** Funds cannot be withdrawn without a declared, verifiable purpose.
*   **Immutable Audit Trail:** A public ledger of exactly when funds were received and when/where they were distributed.
*   **Transparency Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface for donors to "follow the money" from wallet to beneficiary.

### Phase C: Deployment (Final Implementation)
The final deployment is a "Living System" for restoring dignity. It provides a technical layer of accountability that allows honest NGOs to prove their work.

**Technical Stack:** Cardano (On-chain Verification), Web3 Wallets, Transparent Frontend Dashboard.

**Live Status:** Functional platform enabling transparent fund management.

## Achievements & Reflections

The Dev-Lords' biggest achievement was recognizing that technology's role wasn't just to move money, but to **witness** it. By making the "invisible visible," they have created a tool that can scale poverty alleviation efforts across Nigeria.

**Key Milestone:** The pivot from "Donation Tracking" to "Distribution Verification."

> [!TIP]
> **The "Big Lesson":** "Transparency creates accountability, accountability restores trust, and trust increases participation."
