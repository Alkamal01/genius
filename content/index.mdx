**Translating field research into blockchain solutions for Prisma and WADA.**

Project Genius Hub — Zaria is an innovation engine dedicated to empowering local developers, researchers, and creators to build meaningful solutions rooted in community-centred discovery. As a center for high-impact innovation, we provide the space, mentorship, and technical tools needed to translate rigorous field research into publishable, real-world blockchain applications. Our mission is to bridge the gap between local problem discovery and global technology standards, building local capacity while connecting grassroots projects to international mentors and competitive prizes.

The CATS Hackathon isn’t just about writing scripts; it’s about engineering social change. We take the raw insights from the streets and classrooms of Zaria and turn them into decentralized realities on the Cardano blockchain.
