# Project Genius Hub — Zaria

## Hacking the system — not just the code.

Project Genius Hub Zaria supports **community-centred problem discovery, rapid prototyping and evidence-based solutions**. We help local teams translate field research into clear, publishable submissions for Prisma and WADA while building local capacity and connecting projects to mentors and prizes.
