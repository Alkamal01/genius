# 🌱 Onboarding: Sensing Potential
**November 11, 2025**

## The Opening of the Container
This wasn't just an orientation—it was an invitation into a different way of working. The first gathering of the Project Genius Hub cohort, this session established the foundational shift that would guide everything to come: the movement from "solving problems" to "sensing potential."

## What Happened
We didn't hand participants a problem brief or a technical specification. Instead, we asked them to unlearn. To set aside the hero narrative of "fixing broken communities" and embrace the humbler, more powerful work of listening until the place tells you what it wants to become.

Through guided discussion and reflective exercises, we broke down core regenerative principles:
*   Why relationship must precede transaction
*   How technology can amplify local connection rather than replace it
*   The difference between building dependency and building capacity
*   What it means to work at the speed of trust

**The Shift:** Teams left this session with a new question echoing in their minds: Not "What can we build?" but "What does this place want to teach us?"

This was the spark. The Enactment phase would be the flame.
