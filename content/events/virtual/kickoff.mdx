# 🔥 Hackathon Kickoff: Sense of Place
**November 25, 2025 · Special Guest: Tobias Fechner (Prisma)**

## When the Journey Officially Began
With Tobias Fechner joining us from Prisma, this session marked the official launch of Phase 1: Ignition. But more than logistics and timelines, Tobias brought something essential: a vision of what technology grounded in place actually looks like.

## The Core Teaching
**"Your code will only be as alive as your understanding of the ground it serves."**

Tobias shared stories from his own work—moments when elegant solutions failed because they ignored local reality, and moments when simple tools flourished because they honored the wisdom already present. He challenged teams to resist the seduction of abstract problem-solving and instead pursue Ground Truths discovered through lived process and sensory immersion.

## The Four Movements Introduced
1.  **The Walk:** Until you can feel the smell of the place
2.  **The Draw:** Capturing what language cannot hold
3.  **The Talk:** Seeking the caretakers—elders and young leaders
4.  **The Write:** Synthesizing spirit into story

**What Changed:** Teams stopped asking "What's our idea?" and started asking "Where will we walk first?"
The building was about to be left behind. The real curriculum was waiting outside.
