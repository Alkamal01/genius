# Event 2 Prize — Fast Prototyping Winner

**Purpose:** Prize for the best rapid prototype demonstrated at The Builders' Assembly (Dec 06).

---

## 🏆 Prize Description

**Award for:** Best rapid prototype that shows user testing, evidence, and a plausible next step.

**Prize includes:**
- 💰 **₦25,000 cash** OR **₦30,000 voucher** (winner's choice)
- 🎓 **2-hour mentor session** with technical expert
- 🛠️ **Equipment grant** (₦10,000) for continued development
- 🎤 **Demo slot** at The Refinery to showcase progress

**Announced:** Dec 06, 2025 at The Builders' Assembly

---

## 📊 Judging Criteria

Prototypes are evaluated on four key criteria:

### 1. Clarity of Problem (25%)

**What judges look for:**
- Is the problem clearly defined?
- Do you know who it affects and how?
- Is it backed by field research evidence?
- Can you articulate the root cause?

**Good example:**
> "200+ Sabon Gari vendors lose 30-40% revenue during rains due to blocked drains from plastic waste. Individual collection costs ₦200/day (too expensive). Previous collective system failed due to payment coordination."

**Poor example:**
> "Waste is a problem in markets."

---

### 2. Prototype Relevance (30%)

**What judges look for:**
- Does the prototype address the root cause?
- Is it appropriate for the context (tech level, cost, maintenance)?
- Does it build on existing practices?
- Is it locally maintainable?

**Good example:**
> "Shared collection drum with SMS payment (vendors already use mobile money). Simple mechanical design (local metal workers can repair). Builds on existing recycling cooperative relationship."

**Poor example:**
> "Complex IoT sensor system requiring cloud infrastructure and smartphone app (vendors have basic phones)."

---

### 3. Evidence of Testing (30%)

**What judges look for:**
- Have you tested with real users?
- Do you have quotes/feedback from testing?
- Photos/video of people using the prototype?
- What did you learn from testing?

**Good example:**
> "Tested payment willingness with 15 vendors: 13/15 (87%) said yes at ₦50/day. Tested drum placement with market manager + 5 vendors. Manager approved location; vendors confirmed it's on their daily path."

**Poor example:**
> "We plan to test it next week" or "Our friends said it's a good idea."

---

### 4. Potential to Scale (15%)

**What judges look for:**
- Clear next steps for expansion
- Realistic resource requirements
- Path to sustainability
- Evidence of demand

**Good example:**
> "Pilot with 1 drum in Block A (200 vendors). If successful after 2 weeks, expand to Blocks B-D (600 more vendors). Market manager committed to official support if pilot works. Recycling cooperative confirmed they'll buy sorted plastic."

**Poor example:**
> "We'll scale to all markets in Nigeria" (with no evidence or plan).

## ✅ Submission Requirements

To be eligible, your prototype must include:

### Technical Demonstration
- [ ] **Working prototype** (can be low-fidelity, but must function)
- [ ] **5-minute demo** showing how it works
- [ ] **Photos/video** of the prototype in use

### Evidence of Testing
- [ ] **Minimum 3 user tests** with real people (not team members)
- [ ] **Quotes from testers** about what works/doesn't work
- [ ] **Photos** of people using the prototype
- [ ] **Documented learnings** from testing

### Documentation
- [ ] **Problem statement** (who, what, where, why)
- [ ] **How it works** (simple explanation)
- [ ] **Testing results** (numbers, observations, quotes)
- [ ] **Next steps** (what you'll do next)
- [ ] **Resource needs** (what you need to continue)

## 💡 What "Rapid Prototype" Means

### Acceptable Prototypes

✅ **Low-fidelity but functional:**
- Paper prototype tested with users
- Physical mockup (cardboard, tape, markers)
- Simple SMS system (manual backend)
- Wizard-of-Oz prototype (you manually do what tech would do)
- Basic working code (doesn't need to be polished)

✅ **Focus on learning, not perfection:**
- Does it test your key assumption?
- Can users interact with it?
- Did you learn something from testing?

### Not Acceptable

❌ **Just ideas or plans:**
- PowerPoint slides with no prototype
- Wireframes with no user testing
- "We're planning to build..."

❌ **No user testing:**
- Built but never shown to users
- Only tested with team members
- No evidence of feedback

---

## 🎯 Tips for Winning

### Build Fast, Test Faster

✅ **Day 1 (Dec 06 morning):**
- Build simplest possible version
- Focus on one core feature
- Use whatever materials you have

✅ **Day 1 (Dec 06 afternoon):**
- Test with 3-5 real users
- Document their feedback (quotes, photos)
- Iterate based on what you learned

✅ **Day 1 (Dec 06 evening):**
- Prepare 5-minute demo
- Document testing results
- Submit before deadline

### What Judges Want to See

**They care about:**
- 🎯 Did you test with real users?
- 📊 What did you learn?
- 🔄 How did you iterate based on feedback?
- 🚀 What's your realistic next step?

**They don't care about:**
- ❌ Polished UI/design
- ❌ Perfect code
- ❌ Fancy features
- ❌ Big promises without evidence
