## 📊 Judging Criteria

Submissions are judged on three main criteria:

### 1. Depth of Interviews (40%)

**What judges look for:**
- Multiple perspectives (vendors, customers, officials, etc.)
- Specific, detailed quotes (not generic statements)
- Evidence of follow-up questions and probing
- Understanding of root causes, not just symptoms

**Good example:**
> Interviewed 11 people including vendors, former collector, market manager, and customers. Quotes show specific economics (₦50-100/day willingness to pay) and root cause (payment coordination, not unwillingness).

**Poor example:**
> Talked to 2 vendors who said "waste is a problem."

---

### 2. Diversity of Sources (30%)

**What judges look for:**
- Different stakeholder groups represented
- Both those affected and those who tried to solve it
- Range of perspectives (not just people who agree)
- Evidence of seeking out contradictory views

**Good example:**
> Sources include: vendors (those affected), former collector (failed solution), market manager (authority), customers (indirect impact), recycling cooperative (potential partner).

**Poor example:**
> Only interviewed vendors in one section of the market.

---

### 3. Clarity of Problem (30%)

**What judges look for:**
- Clear articulation of who, what, where, why
- Specific numbers and details
- Root cause identified (not just symptoms)
- Evidence-backed claims

**Good example:**
> "200+ vendors at Sabon Gari Market generate 200-400 bags of plastic waste daily. Individual collection costs ₦200/day (too expensive), and previous collective system failed due to payment coordination issues. Blocked drains cause 30-40% revenue loss during rainy season."

**Poor example:**
> "The market has a waste problem that affects people."

## 💡 Tips for Winning

### What Makes a Winning Entry

✅ **Go deep, not wide:**
- Better to deeply understand one problem than superficially cover many
- Follow-up questions reveal root causes
- Spend 2+ hours in the field, not 30 minutes

✅ **Show your thinking:**
- Document what surprised you (assumptions that were wrong)
- Explain why this matters to real people
- Be honest about what you don't understand yet

✅ **Evidence quality matters:**
- Photos show context, not just close-ups
- Quotes are specific, not generic
- Reflection shows deep thought, not surface observations

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Don't:**
- Interview only people who agree with your solution
- Skip the reflection (just listing facts)
- Take photos without consent
- Paraphrase quotes instead of recording exact words
- Submit at the last minute without review
