## 📊 Judging Criteria

### 1. Quality of Stakeholder Engagement (25%)

**What judges look for:**
- Diversity of stakeholders (users, officials, partners, etc.)
- Depth of engagement (not just one conversation)
- Evidence of ongoing relationship
- Stakeholders' genuine involvement (not just consulted)

**Good example:**
> "Engaged 11 stakeholders: vendors (users), market manager (authority), former collector (failed solution), recycling cooperative (partner), customers (indirect users). Had 3 follow-up meetings with market manager. Cooperative committed to buying sorted plastic. Vendors formed WhatsApp group to coordinate."

**Poor example:**
> "Talked to some vendors once."

### 2. Incorporation of Feedback (25%)

**What judges look for:**
- Specific changes made based on feedback
- Evidence of iteration (before/after)
- Honest about what didn't work
- Clear learning from user testing

**Good example:**
> "Initial idea: smartphone app. Feedback: vendors have basic phones. Changed to: SMS-based system. Tested with 15 vendors. 13/15 successfully sent payment via SMS. Learned: need clearer signage for instructions."

**Poor example:**
> "People liked our idea, so we kept it the same."

---

**What judges look for:**
- Clear articulation of who, what, where, why
