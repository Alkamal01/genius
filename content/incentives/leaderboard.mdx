### Step 1: Verify the Error

Before requesting a correction, check:

### Step 2: Gather Evidence

Prepare the following information:
- **Your name/team name** (exactly as it appears in the sheet)
- **Activity that should have points** (be specific)
- **Link to evidence:**
  - PR link (for PR points)
  - Drive folder link (for uploads)
  - Event attendance confirmation (for presentations)
- **Expected points** (based on the point system)
- **Current points shown** (what the sheet says now)

## 📊 Understanding the Rankings

### How Ranks Are Calculated

**Teams:**
- Ranked by total team points
- Team points = sum of all team activities
- Individual member contributions count toward team total

**Individuals:**
- Ranked by individual points only
- Individual sensing entries, personal uploads
- Does not include team points

### Tie-Breaking Rules

If two teams/individuals have the same points:

1. **Quality of work** (judges review submissions)
2. **Submission time** (earlier is better)
3. **Diversity of activities** (points from multiple categories > all from one)

---

## 🏆 Prize Eligibility

### Point Thresholds

To be eligible for certain prizes, you need minimum points:

| Prize Category | Minimum Points Required |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| **Ground-Potentialising Challenge** | 25 points (must include sensing entry) |
| **Event 2 Prize** | 30 points (must include prototype submission) |
| **Final Winner** | 50 points (must include final presentation) |
| **Category Awards** | Varies by category |

**Note:** Having enough points makes you eligible, but doesn't guarantee winning. Quality of work is the primary judging factor.

## 💡 Tips for Maximizing Points

### Diversify Your Activities

✅ **Don't just focus on one thing:**
- Do field research (sensing entries)
- Submit documentation (PRs)
- Present your work (events)
- Help others (community sharing)

### Quality Over Quantity

✅ **Better to do fewer things well:**
- One excellent sensing entry > three mediocre ones
- One working prototype > ten ideas
- One insightful presentation > multiple rushed ones

### Submit Early

✅ **Early submissions get:**
- More time for feedback and iteration
- Better chance of being featured
- Less stress at deadlines
- Tie-breaker advantage
