**One-line summary:** Creating a decentralized plastic waste collection system with micro-payments for Sabon Gari Market vendors.

**Last updated:** 2025-11-26

---

## Problem Statement

**Who:** 200+ vendors at Sabon Gari Market (Blocks A-D)  
**Where:** Sabon Gari Market, Zaria  
**What:** Lack of affordable collective waste collection leads to blocked drains, pest problems, and customer loss  
**Why it matters:** Vendors lose 30-40% revenue during rainy season due to flooding from blocked drains; public health hazard in food market

Market vendors at Sabon Gari generate 200-400 bags of plastic waste daily with no organized collection system. Individual waste collection is too expensive (₦200/day), and previous collective systems failed due to payment coordination issues. Blocked drains cause flooding during rains, damaging goods and driving away customers, resulting in significant revenue loss.

### Quotes
> "Every morning I sweep plastic bottles from my stall entrance. When it rains, the drains overflow because of all the plastic. My goods get damaged, and customers don't want to walk through the mess." — Amina Mohammed, Vegetable vendor

> "We used to have a waste collector come every day, but he stopped because vendors couldn't pay individually. Now everyone just throws waste wherever." — Musa Abdullahi, Fruit vendor

> "I stopped collecting because I'd spend 3 hours trying to collect ₦200 from each vendor. Some days I'd only collect from 30% of them. It wasn't sustainable." — Sani Garba, Former waste collector

**Total quotes:** 3 (plus 8 more in individual sensing logs)

## Research Notes

### Who Was Interviewed
- Amina Mohammed — Vegetable vendor (12 years) — 2025-11-24 — Sabon Gari Market
- Musa Abdullahi — Fruit vendor — 2025-11-24 — Sabon Gari Market
- Anonymous — Spice vendor — 2025-11-24 — Sabon Gari Market
- Sani Garba — Former waste collector — 2025-11-26 — His home
- Alhaji Bello — Market manager — 2025-11-26 — Market office
- 6 additional vendors (brief conversations) — 2025-11-25 — Various blocks

**Total interviews:** 11 people  
**Sample size:** 11 (targeting 200+ affected vendors)  
**Research dates:** 2025-11-24 to 2025-11-26

### Key Findings

1. **Payment coordination is the core blocker:** Vendors are willing to pay ₦50-100/day for reliable collection, but no system exists for collective payment. The former collector spent more time collecting payment than collecting waste.

2. **Economic impact is significant:** 3 vendors independently estimated 30-40% revenue loss during rainy season due to flooding from blocked drains. This translates to substantial annual income loss.

3. **Previous collective action failed:** Vendors already tried a collective waste collection system 2 years ago. It failed not because of unwillingness, but because of payment infrastructure issues. This means the solution needs to address coordination, not motivation.

## Preliminary Solution Idea / Prototype Description

### Solution Overview
A shared waste collection drum with SMS-based micro-payment system. Vendors send ₦50 via mobile money when they deposit waste. Collector is paid automatically when drum is full and emptied. Visual fill-level marker shows community progress.

### How It Works
1. **Collection drum** installed at market entrance (one per block initially)
2. **Vendors deposit waste** and send ₦50 via mobile money (simple SMS code)
3. **Visual marker** shows drum fill level (painted graduations)
4. **Collector empties drum** when full, receives automatic payment from pooled funds
5. **Recycling cooperative** buys sorted plastic from collector

### Why This Approach
- **Builds on existing:** Vendors already use mobile money; collector already has recycling buyer
- **Solves coordination:** Automated payment removes collection burden
- **Visible progress:** Fill marker creates social proof and collective accountability
- **Locally maintainable:** Simple mechanical drum, no complex tech to break
- **Regenerative:** Creates reliable income for collector, reduces vendor costs, cleaner market

### Technology/Tools Needed
- Large metal drum with lid (₦15,000)
- Paint for fill-level markers (₦2,000)
- Mobile money API integration (research needed)
- Simple SMS gateway (₦5,000/month)
- Signage explaining system (₦3,000)

**Estimated prototype cost:** ₦25,000 + ₦5,000/month

---

## Tests Done

### Test 1: Payment willingness survey
- **Date:** 2025-11-25
- **What we tested:** Would vendors pay ₦50/day for reliable collection?
- **With whom:** 15 vendors across 3 blocks
- **Results:** 13/15 (87%) said yes if payment was easy and collection was consistent
- **What we learned:** Price point is acceptable; "easy payment" and "consistent collection" are critical trust factors

### Test 2: Drum visibility test
- **Date:** 2025-11-26
- **What we tested:** Would a drum at market entrance be visible and accessible?
- **With whom:** Market manager + 5 vendors
- **Results:** Manager approved location; vendors confirmed it's on their daily path
- **What we learned:** Placement matters—needs to be visible but not blocking traffic. Manager wants to see 2-week pilot before full approval.

## Next Steps and Support Needed

### Immediate Next Steps (This Week)
1. **Research mobile money APIs** — Ahmed (by Nov 28)
2. **Source collection drum** — Zainab (by Nov 29)
3. **Create consent forms for pilot** — Ibrahim (by Nov 27)
4. **Design visual fill markers** — Zainab (by Nov 28)
5. **Meet with recycling cooperative** — Fatima (by Nov 30)

### Support Needed
- **Mentorship:** Need help integrating mobile money API (technical mentor with payment systems experience)

- **Funds:** ₦25,000 for prototype materials
- **Access:** Introduction to recycling cooperative contact (if mentor knows anyone)

### Blockers
- **Mobile money API access:** Waiting to hear if we can get sandbox/test access from provider
- **Drum sourcing:** Local metal workers quoted ₦20,000; looking for cheaper option

## 💡 Tips for Quality Team Discovery Logs

### Synthesizing Individual Research

✅ **Good synthesis:**
- Combines findings from multiple team members
- Identifies patterns across interviews
- Shows progression from individual observations to team insights

❌ **Poor synthesis:**
- Just lists individual findings without connection
- No analysis of patterns or contradictions
- Doesn't show how team thinking evolved

### Writing Strong Problem Statements

✅ **Specific and evidence-backed:**
- Names specific people/groups affected
- Quantifies impact where possible
- Explains root cause, not just symptoms
- Backed by quotes and data from research

❌ **Vague problem statements:**
- "People have waste problems"
- No specific location or people
- No evidence of impact
- Confuses symptoms with root causes

### Describing Solutions

✅ **Clear and testable:**
- Explains how it works in simple steps
- Shows why this addresses root cause
- Identifies what's needed to build/test it
- Acknowledges what you don't know yet

❌ **Unclear solutions:**
- Vague "we'll build an app"
- No explanation of how it solves the problem
- No consideration of feasibility
- Overconfident without testing

---

## 🔄 Updating Your Discovery Log

### When to Update

- **After each field visit:** Add new evidence, quotes, photos
- **After team meetings:** Update problem statement, solution ideas
- **After testing:** Document results and learnings
- **Weekly minimum:** Keep "Next Steps" and "Last Updated" current

### What to Update

- Evidence list (as you collect more)
- Research notes (new interviews, findings)
- Problem statement (as understanding deepens)
- Solution description (as you iterate)
- Tests done (document everything you try)
- Next steps (always keep current)

---

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Insufficient Evidence
- ❌ Problem statement not backed by research
- ❌ Only talked to 1-2 people
- ❌ No photos or quotes

**Fix:** Do more field research before finalizing problem statement

### Solution Before Problem
- ❌ Started with a technology and looked for a problem
- ❌ Didn't validate problem with users first
- ❌ Solution doesn't address root cause

**Fix:** Go back to field research, understand the problem deeply first

### No Testing
- ❌ Built solution without user feedback
- ❌ Assumptions not validated
- ❌ No evidence solution would work

**Fix:** Test early and often, even with paper prototypes

### Poor Team Coordination
- ❌ One person doing all the work
- ❌ Duplicate research efforts
- ❌ No clear roles or next steps

**Fix:** Regular team meetings, clear task assignments, shared documentation
