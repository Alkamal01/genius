## Short Reflection (287 words)

### What did you learn?

I learned that the waste problem isn't about people not caring—it's an economic and coordination problem. Vendors are willing to pay for waste collection, but individual collection is too expensive (₦200/day per vendor). The previous collector stopped coming because he couldn't collect payment from everyone consistently.

The problem is worse than I expected. I counted approximately 200 vendors in just three blocks, and each generates 1-2 bags of waste daily. That's 200-400 bags with no organized collection system.

### Why it matters?

This affects vendors' livelihoods directly. Three vendors told me they lose customers during rainy season because the blocked drains create flooding and mess. One vendor estimated 30-40% revenue drop during heavy rains.

It also affects public health—the accumulated waste attracts pests and creates unsanitary conditions where food is sold.

### What surprised you?

I was surprised that vendors already tried collective action before. They had a working system with a waste collector, but it failed due to payment coordination issues. This means the problem isn't lack of willingness—it's lack of infrastructure for collective payment.

I was also surprised by how specific vendors were about the economics. They know exactly how much they'd be willing to pay (₦50-100/day) if payment was reliable and collection was consistent.

### Next steps?

1. Interview the former waste collector to understand why the payment system failed
2. Talk to the market manager about official support for collective waste management
3. Research mobile money or SMS-based payment systems that could solve the coordination problem
4. Map the full scale: how many blocks, how many vendors, total waste volume

## 💡 Tips for Quality Sensing Entries

### Writing Good Headlines

✅ **Specific and actionable:**
- "Sabon Gari vendors lack affordable collective waste collection"
- "ABU students miss classes due to unreliable campus shuttle timing"

❌ **Too vague:**
- "Market has problems"
- "Transportation issues"

### Capturing Good Quotes

✅ **Direct, specific, attributed:**
- Record exact words, not your interpretation
- Include speaker's name (or "Anonymous") and role
- Provide context for when/why they said it

❌ **Poor quotes:**
- Paraphrased: "She said the market was dirty"
- No attribution: "Someone told me..."
- No context: Just the quote with no explanation

### Taking Effective Photos

✅ **Contextual and clear:**
- Show the problem in its environment
- Include people (with consent) to show scale and impact
- Caption explains what we're seeing and why it matters

❌ **Poor photos:**
- Too close up, no context
- Blurry or poorly lit
- No caption or vague caption

### Writing Reflections

✅ **Honest and specific:**
- What surprised you (assumptions that were wrong)
- Specific numbers, names, details
- What you still don't understand
- Concrete next steps

❌ **Generic reflections:**
- "It was interesting"
- "The problem is bad"
- No specific learnings or next steps

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Missing Consent
- ❌ Taking photos without asking
- ❌ Recording conversations without permission
- ❌ Not documenting who consented to what

**Fix:** Always ask first, document consent, offer anonymity

### Insufficient Evidence
- ❌ Only 1-2 quotes instead of 3+
- ❌ Photos without captions
- ❌ No video/audio

**Fix:** Follow the checklist, collect more than minimum

### Vague Observations
- ❌ "People are unhappy about waste"
- ❌ "The market is crowded"
- ❌ "Transportation is a problem"

**Fix:** Be specific with numbers, names, exact quotes

### No Reflection
- ❌ Just listing facts without analysis
- ❌ No mention of what surprised you
- ❌ No next steps

**Fix:** Think deeply about what you learned and what it means
