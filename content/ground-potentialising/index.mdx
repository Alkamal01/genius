# Ground-Potentialising — Sensing Zaria

**Purpose:** Explains field research goals, leaderboard system, and how individual vs team sensing works.

---

## 🌍 What is Ground-Potentialising?

**Ground-Potentialising means going into the place** — meeting people, listening, and collecting evidence before building. 

This section captures individual and team field work and **rewards those who gather deep local insight**.

### Why It Matters

- 🎯 **Real problems** come from real people, not assumptions
- 📊 **Evidence-based** solutions are more likely to succeed
- 🤝 **Community trust** is built through listening, not telling
- 🏆 **Quality research** is recognized and rewarded

---

## 🎯 Key Goals

### 1. Listen to Local People and Record Real Problems

**What this means:**
- Spend time in the community observing and asking questions
- Talk to people affected by the problem, not just experts
- Document what you hear in their own words (quotes)
- Understand context: why does this problem exist? What have people already tried?

**Not acceptable:**
- ❌ Assumptions based on what you think the problem is
- ❌ Solutions looking for problems
- ❌ Interviewing only your friends or family

---

### 2. Gather Evidence for Every Meaningful Discovery

**Minimum requirements for each field visit:**
- ✅ **3 photos** — showing the problem context, people, place
- ✅ **3 quotes** — direct statements from people affected
- ✅ **Short video** (60-120 seconds) OR audio recording with transcript

**Why this matters:**
- Evidence proves you did the work
- Photos and quotes make your story compelling
- Video/audio captures tone and context that text misses

---

### 3. Turn Insights into Problem Statements and Prototypes

**The progression:**
1. **Field research** → Collect evidence and quotes
2. **Synthesis** → Identify patterns and root causes
3. **Problem statement** → Clear articulation of who, what, where, why
4. **Prototype idea** → Testable solution based on insights

**Example progression:**
- *Field research:* "Vendors say drains block every 2 days"
- *Synthesis:* Waste collection is individual, expensive, inconsistent
- *Problem statement:* "200+ vendors lack affordable collective waste collection"
- *Prototype:* Shared collection drum with micro-payment system

- Content: Single visit with evidence and reflection
- Purpose: Build individual research skills and contribute to team knowledge

**Who should create these:**
- Anyone doing field research, whether on a team or solo
- Team members documenting their individual contributions
- People exploring problems before forming a team

---

### [Teams](/ground-potentialising/teams)

**Team discovery pages** and submission drafts:
- Format: `Team [Name] — Discovery Log & Submission Draft`
- Content: Aggregated research, problem statement, prototype plans
- Purpose: Synthesize individual findings into team direction

**What teams document:**
- Combined evidence from all team members
- Problem statement based on research
- Preliminary solution ideas
- Tests and results
- Next steps and support needs

## 📋 Quick Start Checklist

Before your first field visit:

- [ ] Read the [Regenerative Development Principles](/process/regenerative-development-principles)
- [ ] Prepare consent forms (see [FAQ](/learning-library/faq))
- [ ] Charge your phone/camera
- [ ] Review the [individual sensing template](/ground-potentialising/individuals)
- [ ] Identify 3-5 people you want to interview

After your field visit:

- [ ] Upload photos to Drive immediately
- [ ] Transcribe quotes while fresh in your memory
- [ ] Document consent (who agreed, what they agreed to)
- [ ] Write your reflection (200-300 words)
- [ ] Submit via the upload form

## 💡 Tips for Effective Field Research

### Before You Go

- **Research the context** — What's already known about this problem?
- **Prepare questions** — Open-ended, not yes/no
- **Bring consent forms** — Get permission before recording
- **Go with a partner** — Safer and you can compare notes

### During Your Visit

- **Observe first** — Spend 15-30 minutes just watching
- **Ask "why" and "how"** — Not just "what"
- **Record exact words** — Don't paraphrase quotes
- **Take contextual photos** — Show the place, not just close-ups
- **Note what surprises you** — Assumptions that were wrong

### After Your Visit

- **Upload immediately** — Don't lose photos or forget details
- **Reflect honestly** — What did you learn? What confused you?
- **Share with team** — Discuss patterns and insights
- **Follow up if needed** — Sometimes you need a second visit

---

## 🤝 Ethical Field Research

### Consent is Mandatory

- ✅ Explain who you are and what you're doing
- ✅ Ask permission before taking photos or recording
- ✅ Offer anonymity if people prefer
- ✅ Show people what you captured (if possible)
- ✅ Document their consent

### Respect and Reciprocity

- **Respect people's time** — Keep interviews to 10-15 minutes unless they want to talk longer
- **Give back** — Share your findings, offer to help if you can
- **Be honest** — Don't make promises you can't keep
- **Protect privacy** — Don't share identifying information without permission

**See [Regenerative Development Principles](/process/regenerative-development-principles) for more on ethical engagement.**

## 📊 Quality Standards

### Good Field Research

✅ **Specific and detailed**
- "Vendors spend 30-45 minutes daily sweeping plastic from their stalls"

✅ **Multiple perspectives**
- Interviewed vendors, customers, waste collectors, market manager

✅ **Evidence-backed**
- Photos show the problem, quotes explain impact, video demonstrates scale

❌ **Poor Field Research**

- ❌ Vague: "The market has a waste problem"
- ❌ Single source: Only talked to one person
- ❌ No evidence: Just descriptions, no photos or quotes
