# Ground-Potentialising — Sensing Zaria

Ground-Potentialising means going into the place — meeting people, listening, and collecting evidence before building. This section captures individual and team field work and rewards those who gather deep local insight.

## Key Goals

* Listen to local people and record real problems.

* Gather 3 photos + 3 quotes + short video for every meaningful discovery.

* Turn insights into a team problem statement and a prototype idea.

## Leaderboards & Incentives

Points for uploads, PRs, and presentations. (See [Incentives page](/incentives) for details.)

## How Pages Are Organised

* **Individuals**: personal sensing pages (name + date + evidence).

* **Teams**: team discovery pages and submission drafts.

## Immediate Action for Participants
