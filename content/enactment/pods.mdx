# Pods & Matchmaking

**Purpose:** Explain pods, how pods form, and how individuals join pods.

## 🎯 What is a Pod?

A **Pod** is a small group forming around a single, well-framed problem. 

**Key characteristics:**
- 📋 **Problem-focused** — United by a specific problem statement
- 🤝 **Skill-diverse** — Combines different skills (dev, researcher, scribe, designer)
- 👥 **Small** — 2-3 members initially, growing to 4-6
- 🚀 **Pre-team** — Not yet a full team, still recruiting

**When a pod reaches 4–6 members, it becomes a confirmed team and gets:**
- Official team folder
- Team page in the directory
- Access to team resources
- Eligibility for team prizes
