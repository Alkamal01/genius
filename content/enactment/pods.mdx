# Pods & Matchmaking

## What is a Pod?

A pod is a small group forming around a single, well-framed problem. Pods combine different skills (dev, researcher, scribe, designer).

## How to Join

* Fill the Pod sign-up form [LINK] — list skills you can offer.

* Pod leads will invite members based on needs listed.

* When a pod reaches 4–6 members, it becomes a team and gets a team folder.

## Pod Listing Format

For each pod:

* Pod name, problem statement, current members (roles), needs (list), join link
