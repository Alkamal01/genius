### "You cannot solve a problem you haven't felt."


This section serves as the **Evidence Locker** for Project Genius Hub. Before writing a single line of code, our participants went into the streets of Zaria—markets, hospitals, transport hubs, and schools—to observe the system dynamics firsthand.


## 🎯 The Goal
To move from "Assumptions" (what we think the problem is) to "Evidence" (what the problem actually is).


## 📂 Research Directory
We have categorized our findings into two streams:
* **[👤 Individual Sensing](./individuals.md):** Solo explorers who went out to observe specific locations.
* **[👥 Team Sensing](./teams.md):** Early groups who conducted joint field research.


## 🏆 The "Insight Lab" Harvest
On **Dec 3rd**, we gathered at the Hub to synthesize this data. The insights logged here are the direct output of that strategy session.

│   ├── -# Enrolment Process


**"We don't group by friendship. We group by Inquiry."**


At Project Genius Hub, enrolment is not just filling a sign-up sheet. It is a filtering process designed to ensure every team is built on a solid foundation of local research.


## 1. The "Driver" Profiling
Every participant begins by filling the **(Driver Form)[https://tally.so/r/2EjjPD]**. This acts as a sensing tool to map the "Human Assets" of Zaria against local problems.
* **We identify Roles:** Are you a Builder (Code), a Weaver (Context), or a Scribe (Docs)?
* **We identify Domains:** Do you care about Waste, Transport, or Health?


## 2. The "Sensing" Gate
Before forming a team, participants must engage in **Ground-Potentialising**. You cannot build a solution for a problem you haven't seen.
* **Solo/Group Fieldwork:** Participants visit markets, schools, or streets.
* **Evidence:** They submit video/photo evidence of the problem.


## 3. The "Meld" (Team Formation)
We use the data from the Driver Form and Sensing phase to form **Pods**.
* **The Pod:** A temporary cluster of people interested in the same problem (e.g., The "Waste Pod").
* **The Team:** Once a Pod agrees on a PRD (Project Requirement Doc) and has the required mix (3 Tech / 2 Non-Tech), they become a **Confirmed Team**.

│   ├── Documentation-# Documentation Strategy


**"If it is not on the Docs, it did not happen."**


We use a **"Scribe & Custodian"** model to ensure high-quality documentation without forcing every participant to master Git/obsidien immediately.


## 1. The Role of the Scribe
Every team must designate one member as the **Scribe**.
* **Responsibility:** Capturing daily learnings, photos, code snippets, and failure logs.
* **Tools:** Camera (Phone), Notepad, and the Submission Portal.


## 2. The Submission Workflow
We have removed the technical barrier. Teams do not push to Main.
1.  **Capture:** The Team completes a task (e.g., User Interview or AI Prototype).
2.  **Submit:** The Scribe fills the **[Daily Progress Form]([https://tally.so/r/A7rrok])**.
    * *Uploads photos/videos to the Shared Drive.*
    * *Writes the 200-word summary.*
3.  **Publish:** The Hub Docs Custodian (Tech Lead-Kamal) reviews the entry, formats it into Markdown, and commits it to the Official Repository(Docs).


## 3. Naming Conventions
To keep our data organized, we use the following file naming structure in our archives:
* `YYYY-MM-DD_TeamName_ActivityType`
* *Example:* `2025-11-26_TeamWaste_MarketVisit.mp4`

│   ├── Regenerative Develpment Principles-# Regenerative Development Principles


**"Healing the System, Not Just Patching It."**


Our Hackathon follows the Prisma/WADA framework for Regenerative Development. We are moving away from "Extractive Tech" (building apps to extract user data/money) towards "Regenerative Tech" (building systems that restore capacity to Zaria).


## 1. Place-Sourced Potential
* **The Principle:** Solutions must emerge from the unique essence of **Zaria**. We do not copy-paste Silicon Valley apps.
* **In Practice:** We go to Sabon Gari market. We study the transport flow in Samaru. We build for *our* reality.


## 2. Whole-Systems Thinking
* **The Principle:** Do not solve a problem in isolation. Understand the upstream causes and downstream effects.
* **In Practice:** If you build a waste recycling app, you must also understand the livelihood of the local bottle scavengers (Baban Bola). Does your app displace them or empower them?


## 3. Potential over Problems
* **The Principle:** Don't just fix what is broken. Look for what wants to grow.
* **In Practice:** Instead of just "stopping trash," can we view waste as a "misplaced resource" that can generate energy or revenue for the community?


## 4. Nested Systems
* **The Principle:** Our project sits inside a larger system.
* **In Practice:** Your Team sits inside the Hub. The Hub sits inside Zaria. Zaria sits inside the WADA network. We share learning across these levels.


│   ├── Mentoship and Support-# Mentorship & Support


**"You are not hacking alone."**


We have structured three layers of support to ensure no team remains stuck for more than 24 hours.


## Level 1: Peer Support (The Pods)
* Check with your Pod members first.
* Use the WhatsApp Group to ask: *"Has anyone solved this Vercel error?"*


## Level 2: The Hub Technical Team
* For blockers related to:
    * **Code:** (AI integration, GitHub, Frontend bugs)
    * **Docs:** (Submission issues)
    * **Logistics:** (Venue access, Power)
* **Action:** Fill the Request Form below.


## Level 3: Expert Network (The Refinery)
* We have a pool of subject matter experts (Lecturers, Founders, domain specialists).
* Access to these experts is unlocked during **"The Refinery"** phase or by special request for high-performing teams.


## 🆘 Request Help
Stuck? Fill this form and we will deploy a mentor to you.

**"Tools for Thinking, Not Just Coding."**


Welcome to the knowledge base. Here you will find the frameworks, mental models, and guides needed to succeed in the Project Genius Hub System Change Hackathon.


## 🧠 Core Concepts
* **[🌱 Regenerative Development](./regenerative-development.md):** Understanding the core philosophy of WADA and Prisma.
* **[🕸️ Systems Thinking Primer](./systems-thinking.md):** How to see the whole picture (Actors, Flows, and Leverage Points).


## 🛠️ Practical Guides
* **[📖 Case Studies](./case-studies.md):** Real-world examples of what a "Regenerative Solution" looks like.
* **[🗣️ Storytelling & Narrative](./storytelling-guides.md):** How to pitch your project to judges and stakeholders.


## ❓ Help
* **[FAQ](./faq.md):** Frequently Asked Questions about the Hackathon rules and logistics.


    ├── Regenerative Development-# Regenerative Development: A Primer


**Conventional Tech** asks: *"How can I scale this app to 1 million users and make money?"*
**Regenerative Tech** asks: *"How can this solution heal the system and build capacity for the community?"*


## The 3 Core Principles


### 1. Place-Sourced Potential
Every solution must be grounded in the unique reality of **Zaria**.
* **Bad:** Copying an Uber model from San Francisco.
* **Good:** Creating a tricycle (Keke) coordination system that respects how Zaria drivers already operate.
* **Action:** Don't import solutions. Export the unique potential of our place.


### 2. Whole-Systems Thinking
You cannot solve a problem in isolation. Everything is connected.
* **Example:** If you build a plastic recycling machine, where does the power come from? Who collects the plastic? Does it take jobs away from local scavengers, or does it help them earn more?
* **Action:** Map the entire flow before you build the app.


### 3. Potential, Not Just Problems
We often obsess over "fixing what is broken." Regenerative development looks for "what wants to grow."
* **Shift:** Instead of seeing "Waste" as a problem to be hidden, see it as "Resource" that can generate energy or materials.


    ├── Case Studies-# Case Studies: What Good Looks Like


Here are examples of how to apply Systems Thinking to local problems.


## Case 1: The "Smart" Trash Can vs. The Community Hub
* **The Problem:** Plastic bottles blocking drains in Sabon Gari market.
* **❌ The Conventional Fix:** Build a "Smart Trash Can" with sensors that tells the government when it is full.
    * *Why it fails:* Requires internet, batteries, and government trucks that might not exist.
* **✅ The Regenerative Solution:** A "Waste-to-Value" exchange point where market women can trade plastic for phone credit. The plastic is processed locally into bricks.
    * *Why it works:* It aligns incentives. It uses local labor. It turns waste into currency.


## Case 2: The Transport App
* **The Problem:** Students waiting too long for shuttles at Kongo Campus.
* **❌ The Conventional Fix:** An Uber-style booking app.
    * *Why it fails:* Data is expensive. Drivers don't look at maps while driving.
* **✅ The Regenerative Solution:** A simple SMS/USSD queue system that alerts the Park Manager when demand spikes, allowing them to release more buses efficiently.
    * *Why it works:* Low tech, high impact, fits existing behavior.


    ├── Storytelling & Narrative Guides-# Storytelling & Narrative Guide


When submitting your project to WADA/Prisma, you are not just submitting code. You are telling a story of change.


## The "Context-First" Pitch Structure


Do not start with "We built an App using Python." Start with the story.


### 1. The Hook (The Ground)
* "We went to Zaria Central Market and spoke to Amina, a tomato seller."
* "She loses 40% of her stock because she cannot predict when the truck will arrive."


### 2. The Insight (The Gap)
* "We realized the problem isn't the truck; it's the *communication gap* between the driver and the seller."


### 3. The Solution (The Enactment)
* "We built 'Agri-Link', a simple USSD tool that connects them."


### 4. The Impact (The Potential)
* "By fixing this link, we don't just save tomatoes; we increase Amina's income by 40%."


## Checklist for your Video Pitch
* [ ] Did you show the physical location?
* [ ] Did you interview a real user?
* [ ] Did you show the prototype working?
* [ ] Is the audio clear?


    ├── Systems Thinking Primer-# Systems Thinking Primer


When you go out for **Ground-Potentialising**, don't just look at the surface. Look at the system.


## The Iceberg Model
1.  **Events (What happened?):** "The drain is blocked."
2.  **Patterns (Has it happened before?):** "The drain blocks every rainy season."
3.  **Structure (Why does it happen?):** "There is no official waste collection, so people dump trash in the gutter."
4.  **Mental Models (The deep belief):** "People believe 'Once I drop it, it's not my problem'."


## How to Map a System
To build a good solution, map these three things:


### 1. The Actors
Who is involved?
* *Direct:* The User, The Customer.
* *Indirect:* The Government, The Community, The Competitor.


### 2. The Flows
What moves between them?
* Money? Information? Waste? Trust?


### 3. The Leverage Point
Where is the smallest change that creates the biggest impact?
* *Example:* Changing the incentives (paying for trash) is a higher leverage point than just cleaning the gutter (reacting to trash).

Stages (simple list):
                                 1. Ground (listen & collect)

                                 2. Define (problem statement & user)

                                 3. Prototype (fast & cheap)

                                 4. Test (small local tests)

                                 5. Reflect (document and iterate)

Weekly rhythm example:
                                    * Monday: fieldwork plan

                                    * Wednesday: small team check-in — share findings
