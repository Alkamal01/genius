Title: Ground-Potentialising — Sensing Zaria
Intro paragraph: Ground-Potentialising means going into the place — meeting people, listening, and collecting evidence before building. This section captures individual and team field work and rewards those who gather deep local insight.
Key goals:
                     * Listen to local people and record real problems.

                     * Gather 3 photos + 3 quotes + short video for every meaningful discovery.

                     * Turn insights into a team problem statement and a prototype idea.

Leaderboards & incentives (short): Points for uploads, PRs, and presentations. (See Incentives page for details.)
How pages are organised:
                        * Individuals: personal sensing pages (name + date + evidence).

                        * Teams: team discovery pages and submission drafts.

Stages (simple list):
                                 1. Ground (listen & collect)

                                 2. Define (problem statement & user)

                                 3. Prototype (fast & cheap)

                                 4. Test (small local tests)

                                 5. Reflect (document and iterate)

Weekly rhythm example:
                                    * Monday: fieldwork plan

                                    * Wednesday: small team check-in — share findings

Purpose: a practical primer and reading links for teams.
Title: Regenerative Development — Primer
Short intro: Short practical summary: listen, work with existing systems, plan for long-term stewardship and measure human impact not just lines of code.
Key ideas (bullets):
                                                                        * Start with people and place — not the technology

                                                                        * Prototype quickly, test with real people, learn, iterate

                                                                        * Prioritize solutions that regenerate local capacity

Suggested prompts for teams: Who are the stewards of this problem? What local knowledge exists? How can we support, not replace?

LEARNING LIBRARY — Systems Thinking Primer
Purpose: short introduction and practical prompts for mapping systems.
Title: Systems Thinking — starter prompts
